Abstract —Public finances are one of the fundamental mech-
anisms of economic governance that refer to the financial
activities and decisions made by government entities to fund
public services, projects, and operations through assets. In
today’s globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation’s
public debt landscape can have significant impacts on that of
international finances, necessitating a nuanced understanding of
the correlations between international and national markets to
help investors make informed investment decisions. Therefore,
by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this study
utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US
and International Public Finances and predict the changes
in international public finances based on the changes in US
public finances. With the neural network model achieving a
commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is
able to affirm a discernible correlation and also plot the effect
of US market volatility on international markets. To further test
the accuracy and significance of the model, an economic analysis
was conducted that aimed to correlate the changes seen by the
results of the model with historical stock market changes. This
model demonstrates significant potential for investors to predict
changes in international public finances based on signals from
US markets, marking a significant stride in comprehending the
intricacies of global public finances and the role of artificial
intelligence in decoding its multifaceted patterns for practical
forecasting.

I. I NTRODUCTION
From the United States Treasury to financial administrations
in capital cities across the world, the machinery of governance
is fueled by immense flows of public sector debt and assets
[8]. Public finance encompasses these intricate governmental
financial systems that enable vital public services, investments
in national projects, and broader economic functions funda-
mental for societal stability [1][9].
At its core, public finance is the financial activities and
decisions made by the government to run the country and
provide services to its citizens [3]. Therefore, it represents a
balancing act: governments must judiciously administer assets
generated from tax revenues and manage liabilities in the
form of bond issuances or deficits that fund public welfare
projects [7]. Historically, public finances remained relatively
siloed within the confines of each nation state [4]. Balancesheets tallying streams of tax revenues and towering liabilities
from bond issuances mostly fluctuated from internal dynamics.
However, in today’s intensely integrated global economy, even
minor changes in one country’s public debt markets can
trigger a butterfly effect that links to fiscal conditions across
international bounds [2]. As the acceleration of globalization
unravels traditional borders, understanding the emergence of
these correlations in public finances becomes critical as it
can help investors predict changes to the international markets
based on changes in the US markets [5][6].
The capabilities of artificial intelligence methods have
grown enormously in recent years, now powering innovative
analyses that are rippling across the finance industry [14].
Mathematical and statistical AI approaches can unpack com-
plex patterns in vast financial data sets that evade traditional
techniques [11]. In particular, neural networks have become a
highly useful AI method for gleaning insights from complex,
multidimensional financial data. Neural networks can detect
intricate nonlinear relationships and temporal dynamics within
and between equities, bonds, currencies, and other financial
assets. Their flexible modeling of intricate real-world patterns
in finance data serves neural networks as an invaluable addition
to the AI toolkit revolutionizing 21st century financial analysis.
Therefore, in this research I utilize artificial intelligence
to conduct an analysis of stock change between US and
International Public Finances. By employing a neural network,
I am able to depict the correlations between US and Interna-
tional Public Finances and predict the changes in international
markets based on the changes in US public finances. The
model achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79,
proving a correlation between the two. Furthermore, through
an economic analysis I am able to correlate the changes
seen by the results of the model with historical stock market
changes, overall demonstrating the significant potential of this
model for investors to predict changes in international public
finances based on signals from US markets.
II. M ATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY
A. Materials
In this study, I utilized credit rating history of US Public
Finances and International Public Finances from S&P Global,
since November 1, 2010. While the datasets consisted severalarXiv:2403.18823v1  [q-fin.GN]  10 Dec 20232
metrics, the data points utilized in the analysis were the initial
credit ratings, change in credit ratings, and the date of change
for the all entities examined.
B. Data Preprocessing
To facilitate meaningful comparisons and analyses, a metic-
ulous literature review was conducted for feature engineering.
Recognizing the temporal dimension as a significant factor,
the primary approach involved leveraging the credit rating
change dates as the chronological anchor for the analysis. This
strategic use of time allowed for seamless alignment of data
points from the US and International markets.
The datasets were then concatenated based on the time-
line, ensuring the creation of a cohesive and comprehensive
main dataset for subsequent analysis. This temporal alignment
formed the foundation for understanding and comparing the
dynamics of the credit ratings.
Moreover, during data preprocessing, missing values and
outliers were addressed through careful imputation and nor-
malization techniques. This ensured the integrity of the dataset
and the robustness of subsequent analyses. Exploratory data
analysis was also conducted to gain insights into the distri-
bution and characteristics of the selected metrics, providing
a crucial context for the subsequent application of artificial
intelligence techniques.
By establishing a well-organized and temporally aligned
dataset through rigorous data preprocessing, the subsequent
artificial intelligence-based analysis was poised to effectively
capture and interpret the intricate relationship between changes
in US financial data and their impact on international finances.
C. Artificial Intelligence
In the realm of artificial intelligence, the pivotal aim was
to construct an algorithm that could intricately predict inter-
national public finance ratings based on US public finance
ratings. The foundational element of this AI-based analysis
was the integration of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
based input layer [15]. This specialized layer was meticulously
designed to assimilate and comprehend the nuanced intricacies
embedded within the financial datasets. Notably, the LSTM
played a crucial role in unearthing temporal correlations,
allowing the model to discern evolving patterns over time [12].
The subsequent layer in the neural network architecture
comprised a singular node within the output layer, responsible
for predicting changes in international finances based on the
fluctuations observed in US finances. The LSTM’s significance
extended to facilitating an understanding of correlations be-
tween input and output at specific temporal junctures [13].
This temporal awareness proved essential in capturing causal
relationships across multiple time steps, enriching the model’s
ability to discern the intricate dynamics of financial changes
[16].
To further augment the feature extraction process and enable
intricate nonlinear mapping, a dense layer was strategically
introduced [17]. This layer, adept at extracting key features
from the data, engaged in complex nonlinear mappings be-
tween these extracted features and the target output [18]. Therelationship between the LSTM and dense layers culminated
in the creation of a sophisticated neural network architecture.
This architecture exhibited a remarkable proficiency in com-
prehending the intricate relationships within time series data.
Through this strategic combination, the neural network not
only effectively mapped changes in US financial data but also
demonstrated a remarkable capacity to predict corresponding
shifts in international finances. The model’s prowess in cap-
turing spatiotemporal correlations validated the efficacy of the
chosen AI methodology, showcasing its potential to provide
nuanced insights into the complex dynamics underlying the
relationship between US and international public finances.
III. R ESULTS
To measure the accuracy of the neural network one key
metric was utilized: the Mean Squared Error(MSE). The
MSE that the neural network was able to achieve was 2.79,
indicating that the neural network was able to predict the
change that was happening in the international stocks based
on the US stocks with high accuracy. Furthermore, to see how
well the neural network was learning the data it was important
to look into the way the neural network was learning the data
throughout the epochs. The neural network’s ability to learn
the data can be seen in Figure 1.
Fig. 1: Loss Function as Neural Network Learns
The data graph was created through detailed statistical anal-
ysis which clearly showed major financial market changes over
recent years. By examining the graphs and charts, I saw subtle
indications in metrics and trends preceding these shifts. For
example, small volatility upticks often foreshadowed larger
spikes and turbulence. Similarly, gradual trading volumes and
frequency pattern changes exposed developing momentum
before rapid price rises or falls. Though major shifts seem
sudden, analysis shows small tremors often presage them,
representing building pressure within the system. Identifying
those early signs allows one to predict and prepare for coming
movements. So by creating data visualizations and analyses,
I illuminated complex indicators preceding and prompting the
most significant changes.3

IV. E CONOMIC ANALYSIS
Based on Figure 2, we are able to see the robust result
of the model in terms of analyzing the correlation between
the changes in public finances among US and International
entities, and specifically how these international entities react
to changes within the US. However, to verify this trend, we can
compare the change in the US Public Finances to major stock
events that occurred in the past 10 years, to check if the model
indeed matches and see the correlating change the events have
on international markets in terms of how much stocks changed
and how long it took for the international markets to reflect
those changes.
Starting with the first major change we see in Figure 2,
which takes place in 2011, can be credited to the stock market
crash on August 8, 2011. In August 2011, the stock market
plunged largely due to a cascading crisis of confidence among
investors triggered by mounting debt fears in Europe and a
stall in US economic growth recovery [19]. Specifically, the
downgrade of the US credit rating, ongoing failure by US and
European leaders to contain the Eurozone crisis, and skittish
reactions from regulators created a panic. Investors frantically
sold off stocks across global exchanges, withdrawing over $15
billion in assets within days and shifting capital to perceived
safer investments like treasury bonds. The benchmark S&P
500 fell 10.7% between July 22 and August 8. Overall,
trillions in equity value evaporated within weeks due to this
macroeconomic uncertainty combined with political paralysis,
uninspiring economic fundamentals, and unreliable growth
projections from corporations. The plunging markets reflected
overwhelmed central banks, credit contraction, recession fears,
and loss of investor faith in the system to properly value assets
and risks [10]. As seen in Figure 2, this crash is representedby the change in the US Public Finances, with the change
in International Public Finances following at the beginning of
2012.
In 2013, we see a similar decline in the US public finances,
which is likely a result of the 2013 federal government
shutdown. The 2013 federal government shutdown was a
political budget crisis that resulted from the failure of Congress
to pass regular appropriations bills required to fund federal
government operations [20]. The shutdown lasted 16 days in
October 2013 due to an impasse between Republican and
Democrat lawmakers on government spending. During the
shutdown period, many routine governmental services halted,
federal sites closed, hundreds of thousands of nonessential
federal employees were furloughed, and spending on contracts
to businesses deferred. This disruption significantly lowered
income, corporate, payroll and other tax revenues flowing
into public finances for funding governance. Additionally, the
shutdown provoked fiscal uncertainty that introduced volatility
in financial markets and dampened projections for economic
growth- also limiting prediction reliability for cyclically-
sensitive tax obligations. Overall the shutdown was estimated
to curb GDP by $24 billion and substantially cut near-term tax
inflows into public finances. Thus the ripple effects from the
2013 political crisis likely translated into a pronounced dip and
deceleration in overall US public finances accumulation that
year- both directly from the temporary suspension of taxation
streams, and indirectly via market and economic impacts
eroding revenue performance tied to the shutdown. This dip
likely could have also been a result of the 2013 NASDAQ
Flash Freeze. On August 22, 2013, an unprecedented three-
hour outage froze trading on the NASDAQ stock exchange,
suspending all transactions and paralyzing the second-largest4
stock market in the US [21]. With over $25 billion worth of
transactions affected and market confidence rattled, the techni-
cal glitch introduced enough fiscal and economic uncertainty
that year to likely translate into a pronounced dip in income,
capital gains, and investor sentiment-driven tax revenues for
U.S. public finances. As seen by the international trend line,
this crash was reflected at the beginning of 2014.
In Figure 2, we also see another dip in the year of 2015-16,
which was likely a result of the 2015-16 stock market selloff,
a period of decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
S&P 500 Index, and NASDAQ Composite that lasted from
August 18, 2015 until February 11, 2016 [22]. Triggered by
fears of a slowdown in China and plunging oil prices, US
stocks lost over 10% of value in just 6 days in August 2015,
indicative of a market correction veering into bear market
territory. While US economic fundamentals remained sound,
the selloff eroded investor confidence and introduced volatility
that persisted for months. With over $3 trillion in global equity
value shed, this historic selloff likely stunted predicted profit
levels, investment plans, and employment expansions upon
which cyclical tax revenue projections for public finances
rely. The bearish sentiment and selloff’s ripple effects likely
slowed multiple taxation income streams from Wall Street
speculation cuts to Main Street economic impacts– translating
into a pronounced dip or disruption in accumulating public
funds during this 2015-2016 period. This crash was reflected
almost immediately by the international markets.
The dip seen in 2018, is indicative of the 2018 cryptocur-
rency crash, which was a massive selloff in the cryptocurrency
markets that accelerated in January 2018, as major digital
assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum plunged over 60% from
record highs set in late 2017 [23]. Catalyzed by new regu-
lations, security breaches, and Facebook banning crypto ads,
the crash wiped out over $300 billion in total cryptocurrency
market capitalization by 2018’s end. With cryptocurrency
investment and trading subject to capital gains tax obligations,
this extreme market correction likely depressed fiscal year tax
payments from digital currency investors declaring losses or
at least hugely reduced gains versus projections. Additionally,
diminished investor appetite filters into sales, payroll, and
corporate taxes if industry contraction or failures transpire.
While still an emerging asset class, crypto’s high growth
suggested the 2018 crash introduced enough economic and
fiscal uncertainty amid plunge warnings that a slight dip in cer-
tain US public finance revenue streams tied to cryptocurrency
could have emerged. This crash was also reflected immediately
by the international markets.
Finally, the last dip seen in 2020 represents the fall as a
result of the Coronavirus pandemic. The 2020 Coronavirus
pandemic was a global viral disease outbreak caused by the
highly contagious COVID-19 virus first identified in Wuhan,
China in late 2019. As the World Health Organization de-
clared a Public Health Emergency in January and pervasive
spread prompted a worldwide economic shutdown by March
2020, US public finances were profoundly disrupted [24].
Mass business closures, supply chain failures, and over 20
million jobs lost within months slowed economic activity to
Depression-era contraction levels and eviscerated tax revenueinputs from income to retail sales to hospitality and transporta-
tion. With interest rates slashed to zero, Congress approved
over $3 trillion in emergency pandemic stimulus and bailouts
by mid-2020 - massively bloating the Federal budget deficit
towards unprecedented peacetime levels over 15% of GDP.
This economic “sudden stop” coupled with tremendous relief
spending created largest shock to the accrual and outflows
of US public finances since World War II, with multi-trillion
dollar budget gaps persisting years later. This dip was also
reflected immediately by international markets.
V. I MPLICATIONS
The ability to model international public finance dynamics
based on signals from US markets demonstrated by this neural
network carries noteworthy practical implications. Investors
and policymakers alike stand to benefit from the predictive
insights and risk analysis enabled by the model’s skill in
mapping cross-border correlations.
Specifically, the model can assist investors in public finance
instruments like government bonds in better diversifying sys-
temic risks in these concentrated, overarching debt markets
that shape broader asset valuations. If US fiscal or monetary
policies portend turbulence that will propagate internationally,
this intelligence allows tactical portfolio adjustments for inter-
national managers. The model may also have predictive power
for relative currency and inflation effects. Policymakers can
likewise employ these projections to make nuanced stimulus
or austerity decisions factoring global impacts.
More broadly, the realized interconnectivity surfaces policy
vulnerabilities like the potential for financial contagions during
crises. This understanding may promote productive coopera-
tive forums between the US and particular foreign nations to
coordinate interventions, regulations, or structural reforms that
mitigate harmful spillovers. However, the throughline between
once discrete public finance systems could also compound
tensions between national and international economic interests.
This neural network’s technical methods constitute an early
stride in a burgeoning subfield of computational intelligence
for fiscal and financial analyses. The promising proof of con-
cept invites streamlining for real-time deployment and pairing
with causal inference techniques to enrich interpretability.
VI. C ONCLUSION
This study demonstrated the efficacy of using artificial
intelligence, specifically LSTM neural networks, to model
intricate correlations between shifts in US public finances
and subsequent impacts on international markets. The model
achieved robust predictive accuracy with a low MSE of 2.79,
capturing discernible relationships in the temporal data.
The analysis of historical periods of volatility further vali-
date the model’s learned linkage between precipitous changes
in US public debt instruments or tax revenues and ensuing
global financial impacts. Periods like the 2011 Stock Market
Crash, 2013 US Government Shutdown, 2015-16 Stock Sell-
off, 2018 Crypto Crash, and 2020 COVID Crisis exhibited
pronounced co-movement between US fiscal disruptions and5
international finance, affirming the model’s technical signal
amidst the noise.
The practical utility of this predictive capacity for both
policymakers and investors is noteworthy. International debt
and currency markets remain concentrated systemic risk points
for global growth. This neural network’s ability to foresee
how US fiscal and monetary actions may propagate abroad
grants a key instrument for scenario analysis, risk evaluation
for international assets, and policy coordination.
While this study marks an initial foray applying machine
learning to decode integrated public finance systems, the
promising proof of concept warrants significant future work.
Scalability to many other national economies, streamlining
for real-time automated outputs, deepening interpretability,
and pairing predictive fiscal AI with policy decision support
systems offer rich potential. As globalization compounds inter-
connectedness, computational intelligence in tracing financial
reverberations across borders grows ever more indispensable.
VII. F UTURE WORKS
While this research pioneered an AI methodology tracing
fiscal interconnectedness between the US and international
markets, it remains an initial foray warranting extensive future
efforts as follow-ons.
One natural progression involves expanding model cover-
age from the singular US economy to multiple other ma-
ture economies and fiscal union entities. Tailoring additional
country-specific LSTM input layers would paint a more global
portrait of public finance co-movements and enhance early
warning systems for cross-border financial contagion threats.
Another critical next step entails streamlining the model for
real-time automated outputs leveraged in live fiscal monitoring
systems. This could enable policymakers to gauge interna-
tional market reactions to major domestic spending bills or tax
policy shifts before enactment. High-frequency trading firms
may also exploit these efficient predictions in their algorithmic
systems.
Further refinement of the neural network with supple-
mentary techniques promises to improve result interpretation
from correlation to precise causation tracing. Incorporating
explainability approaches like SHAP values into model post-
processing can isolate the magnitude of importance of specific
US policy actions on international outcomes. These enriched
insights strengthen multi-lateral coordination efforts.
Lastly, integrating state-of-the-art predictive fiscal AI di-
rectly into policy decision support architectures could un-
lock tremendous upside. Beyond passive market estimations,
optimizing stimulus and taxation levels to navigate global
growth shockwaves through automated intelligence represents
an intriguing continuation. The possibilities are as boundless
as innovation at the intersection of machine learning and public
financial administration in the 21st century global economy.
