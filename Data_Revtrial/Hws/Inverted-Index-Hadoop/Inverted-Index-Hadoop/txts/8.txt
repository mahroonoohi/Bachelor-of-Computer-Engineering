Thermodynamically stable low-temperature phases of the Bose-Fermi mixtures composed of
bosons and spinless fermions close to four dimensions are considered. In the regime, where the
only boson-fermion two-body interaction is present and tuned to unitary limit, the properties of a
system solely depend on the mass and number ratios of constituent atoms. In addition to the phase
with the dimers (boson-fermion shallow bound states), we identified one more state of the mixture
with the coexistence of fermionic dimers and trimers. The universal physics of these phases, the
characteristic feature of is absence of the Bose-Einstein condensate, is discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION
In contrast to the condensed matter systems, where
the collective effects are dominative in forming of their
behaviors, dilute gases (both classical and quantum) with
the short-ranged interaction between particles can be de-
scribed by the sequential inclusion of the few-body ef-
fects. In this context, the realization of ultracold Bose
and Fermi gases in weakly [1–3] and strongly interacting
[4, 5] regimes opened new possibilities for the experimen-
tal detection of the few-body physics and elucidation of
its impact on the macroscopic properties. An extreme di-
luteness of quantum gases together with the short-range
character of the two-body potential among particles make
these systems a very convenient playground for testing
effective field theories [6, 7]. In such conditions, any
specific details of the microscopic potential are irrele-
vant allowing one to consider theories with contact inter-
actions. The Galilean-invariant Lagrangians with a lo-
cal two-body coupling are non-renormalizable above two
spatial dimensions. However, the intrinsic U(1) symme-
try, which guarantees the particle number conservation,
provides a possibility to treat two-, three- and generally
few-body sectors separately. The ultraviolet (UV) di-
vergences appearing in every next sector can be cured
by introducing new higher-order local interactions with
the cutoff-dependent coupling constant. Then, the UV
dependence of couplings is fixed by requiring the ob-
servables to be cutoff-independent. This renormalization
procedure which is reminiscent of the Wilson-Polchinski
[8, 9] renormalization group (RG) scheme, allows to intro-
duce a set of finite ‘observable’ few-body couplings con-
trolling the universal behavior of a system in the many-
body limit.
The Bose-Fermi mixtures of bosons and spinless (spin-
polarized) fermions are excellent candidates for observing
[10, 11] composite particles in macroscopic systems. The
∗e-mail: volodyapastukhov@gmail.comPauli exclusion principle stabilizes the fermionic mixture
against collapse while numerous Fermi surfaces minimize
its total energy. Even at weak contact boson-fermion
interaction, except a metastable phase [12, 13] with al-
most degenerated Fermi gas and almost undepleted Bose
condensate, there is a lower energy state [14–16] with
coexistence of bosons, atomic and molecular fermions.
If the densities of bosonic atoms are lower than those
of fermionic ones, the Fermi-Fermi (fermion-molecular)
mixture remains stable without boson-boson repulsion.
The Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition in this
system at weak boson-fermion coupling both at zero
[17, 18] and finite [19, 20] temperatures realizes simul-
taneously with the collapse instability. Inclusion of the
repulsive boson-boson interaction provides [21] stabiliza-
tion of the Bose condensate. Recently, the quantum
phase transition [22, 23] from the Fermi-polaron state
to the molecular phase was observed [24] experimentally.
Taking into account a weak induced interaction between
fermions and molecules necessarily leads to superfluidity
characterized [25] by crossover from atomic to molecular
pairing mechanisms.
So far, only degenerated Fermi gases of fermions
and diatomic molecules were mostly prepared [26–29]
in the Bose-Fermi mixtures. In Ref. [30] the forma-
tion of triatomic molecules in these systems was ob-
served. However, an important feature of the Bose-Fermi
mixtures less discussed in the literature is the forma-
tion of fermionic trimers at macroscopic atomic popu-
lations. In three dimensions, this problem is complicated
by the emergence of the Efimov physics [31, 32]. Depend-
ing on the set of parameters: densities of constituents,
the boson-fermion s-wave scattering length, and intrinsic
length-scale determining an infinite tower of the three-
body bound states, the system may include an arbitrary
number of coexisting macroscopically-populated univer-
sal trimer states. The richest composition is reached at
high densities. Since all trimer levels are ‘distinguishable’
fermions, it is energetically preferable to have as many as
possible Fermi surfaces in this limit. In the present paper,
we focus on a different and somewhat simpler situationarXiv:2403.20203v1  [cond-mat.quant-gas]  29 Mar 20242
in the non-physical fractional dimensions and for mass
ratios of the resonantly-coupled bosons and fermions out-
side the Efimov window [18, 33]. When the only parame-
ter characterizing interaction –the boson-fermion s-wave
scattering length– diverges, the thermodynamic proper-
ties and stability condition for the mixtured state are uni-
versal functions of densities and masses of bosonic and
fermionic atoms. Generally, there are no simple ways
to calculate these universal functions, but close to four
dimensions, the ϵ-expansion can be utilized.
II. MODEL AND REVIEW OF ϵ-EXPANSION
The discussed model describes spinless bosons and
spin-polarized fermions in the d-dimensional volume Ld
with periodic boundary conditions. The interaction be-
tween bosonic atoms is neglected, while we assume pres-
ence of a contact boson-fermion (pseudo)potential char-
acterized by a bare coupling constant gΛthat depends

fields b(x), and the Grassmannian fields f(x) and c(x)
describe bosons, and two types of fermions: atoms and
composite fermions (dimers). As it was first mentioned
by Nussinov and Nussinov [34], exactly in d= 4 dimers
do not interact mutually and with other particles. Thisis most easily demonstrated by calculating the vacuum c-
particle propagator in ( d+1)-momentum space [35]. The
only self-energy contribution is given by a single diagram
depicted in Fig. 1

ble solid line). Solid and dotted lines denote fermionic and

with mc=mb+mf. Exactly in d= 4, the above denom-
inator reproduces the inverse propagator of a free com-
posite particle with binding energy εc. More importantly
that arbitrarily close to four dimensions, the residue of
the dimer propagator disappears linearly in ϵ= 4−d(see
2.2). This fact allows to build the perturbation theory
even for strongly interacting systems ( g−1= 0) using ϵ
as a small parameter. Indeed, every diagram containing
one dimer propagator and free of UV divergences car-
ries a small parameter. Therefore, all diagrams can be
classified by the number of ⟨c†c⟩-lines, or equivalently, by
rescaling the c-fields, we can associate the factor√ϵwith
every interaction vertices in action (2.3). All observables
then are calculated as a power series in√ϵ. This was
shown [36] to be an extremely effective analytical tool
for the calculation of thermodynamic and spectral prop-
erties of spin-1 /2 fermions at unitarity. In the rest of
the paper, the ϵ-expansion will be used for examining
properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures mainly in the limit of
infinite boson-fermion coupling. In the two-body sector,
this limit of our model is characterized by the scale (and
even conformal) invariance. If the three-body sector is
also trivial, i.e. there is no Efimov effect in the consid-
ered system, all the above symmetries are preserved.
III. DIMER-FERMION MIXTURE
By neglecting boson-boson interaction we restrict our
consideration to a case of the non-Bose-condensed ground
states of the system, i.e. no single-particle energy level is
macroscopically occupied by the Bose atoms. The pres-
ence of BEC necessarily leads to the collapse of the mix-
ture. This means that all bosons should be bound to
fermionic atoms forming dimers. It is easy to show that
there is always a region in the parameter space, where the
mixture state of the system close to d= 4 at unitarity
is stable. Indeed, in this limit, we are dealing with two
ideal Fermi gases of fermions and dimers. The number of3
dimers is equal to the number of bosons, while all other
fermions are free

For lower densities of fermions, the chemical potential of
bosons crosses zero ( µb<0 in the thermodynamically
stable region) signaling the BEC transition. Recall that
the above conclusions are true only for dextremely close
to four. At small but non-zero ϵwe can elucidate prop-
erties of the system perturbatively. Since there are no
free bosons, the system is a weakly interacting Fermi-
Fermi mixture. Because of the fermionic statistics, this
interaction is repulsive in the s-way channel and one can
apply the Fermi liquid paradigm to calculate the parti-
cle distribution and thermodynamics of the system. The
interaction in such a system only deforms the form of
the momentum distribution but does not the position of
its discontinuity point. By computing the self-energies of
the unbound fermion (Fig. 2, b) and dimer propagators,

therefore, we can identify the chemical potentials µfand

modifies the BEC transition condition (3.7). Lengthy,

for the thermodynamic stability. Note that for a strong
imbalance between masses of bosonic and fermionic
atoms mb≪mf, the correction can be arbitrarily large
shifting the stability condition towards larger fermion
densities.It is well-known that a macroscopic number of fermions
are unstable towards the Cooper pairing at attractive in-
teraction of any magnitude. In our case, when two sorts
of Fermi particles (unbound fermions and dimers) are
built of the same fermionic atom, the only possible pair-
ing channel is the p-wave one. There are, however, a few
possible scenarios of the Cooper pairing compositions,
namely, atom-dimer f−c, atom-atom f−f, and dimer-
dimer c−c(and all possible phases with the coexistence
of different pairings). The latter two are less energetically
preferable since the appropriate interactions are of order
ϵ2(see, Fig. 3). The atom-dimer effective interaction is

of order ϵ, and moving from the normal phase towards
lower temperatures, the p-wave f−csuperfluidity should
be observed. In order to study the peculiarities of this
pairing mechanism to leading order in ϵ, one needs to
sum up an infinite series of ladder diagrams presented in
Fig. 4. The series summation is equivalent to solving an

solution is complicated but close to 4D, where the dimer
propagator (2.4) acquires a pole structure with vanish-
ingly small residue, Eq. (3.9) formalizes in the system
of coupled linear integral equations for functions ψp=

The first one is determined for all |p|> pf, while the
second one is only non-zero for all |p+k|< pc. Con-
sidering for simplicity only case of pf=pc(otherwise,

the solutions to Eq. 3.10 go in pairs σand 4 −σ. In the
limit ϵ→0 exponent σlinearly decreases to zero. For
small enough masses of bosons, there is a region with
complex conjugated exponents σ= 2±iσ0of the p-wave
Efimov effect emergence at arbitrary d. Extremely close
tod= 4, the effective fermion-dimer interaction almost
vanishes, which allows to approximate functions ψp≈
ψpfandϕp≈ϕpfby their values at Fermi surface (recall
that here we only discuss the limit of equal fermion and
dimer populations). This simplification transforms two
integral equations (for ψpandϕp) into a single algebraic
one with the non-trivial solution determining with the
exponential precision, the fermion-dimer binding energy
(and consequently gap in the quasi-particle spectrum)

which is consistent with the Galilean invariance of the
three-body system. Before proceeding with the analysis
of solutions to Eq. (4.16), let us calculate the trimer prop-
agator. It is easy to do when the on-shell vertex function
Tbc(q) is known. Then, the only self-energy contribution
to the trimer propagator is determined by the Feynman
graph shown in Fig. 6. With the Matsubara frequency in

is only affected by the s-wave channel of the boson-dimer
scattering amplitude. In what follows, one needs to con-
sider only spherically-symmetric solutions to Eq. (4.16).5
In arbitrary d, the function Tbc(q) can be found only nu-
merically, but the scaling limit q≫1/awith q≪Λ is ac-
cessible analytically. Keeping in mind that hΛ→∞→0,
and that the cutoff is imposed on summation over the
wave-vector in the r.h.s of (4.16), we can reduce this
equation to the homogeneous one. Then, the scale in-
variance fixes the asymptotic form of the on-shell vertex
Tbc(q)∝1/qη. Plugging this ansatz back into the inte-
gral equation and calculating integrals in arbitrary d, we
arrive at the condition for allowed ηs [18]

there is always range of d∈[dmin, dmax] (see [18]), where
two mutually complex-conjugated solutions η= 1±iη0
occur. The latter is a signal for emergence of the Efi-
mov effect in the three-body system. This is most easily
seen by analyzing Tbc(q)∼sin(η0ln(qr0))
q(here r0is arbi-
trary length scale) at complex ηs. Being solution to ho-
mogeneous integral equation, this vertex coincides with
the three-body zero-energy wave-function. The number
of its nodes, therefore, determines the number of three-
body bound states. Consequently, in the Efimov region
we have an infinite tower of trimers with the character-
istic ratio εt,n/εt,n+1=e2π/η0(n≫1) between binding
energies of two nearest ones. Of course, the calculations
of propagators for the Efimov trimers is interesting prob-
lem, which cannot be solved to the very end in the con-
sidered model. The correct formulation requires to go
beyond the zero-range boson-fermion pairwise interaction
by adopting, for instance, the two-channel model describ-
ing narrow Feshbach resonance. The existence of the ex-
act solution [44, 45] to the three-body problem within
this model in 3D inspires confidence in the calculations
of propagators for the universal Efimov trimers. Apart
from the interval [ dmin, dmax], there could be at most
two bound states. However, when the mass of bosonic
atoms is infinite an exact solution [46] (although only 3D
case is analyzed there, the general picture is same [47]
for any 2 < d < 4) of the three-body problem suggests a
single bound state that satisfies bosonic statistics. Note
thatmb≫mflimit is the most favorable for the trimer
emergence. Therefore, one concludes about an existence
of a single trimer state with energy εt∼ −1
2mbca2outside
the interval [ dmin, dmax]. With the numerically obtained
vertex Tbc(q) we can calculate the trimer propagator. It
is readily seen, taking into account the UV dependence
of both functions Tc(k)Tbc(k), that the sum in (4.17) is
divergent and should be renormalized. The latter is real-
ized by absorbing the leading-order large-Λ term in the
definition of the bare coupling gt,Λ. Recalling that thetrimer propagator should have a simple pole in the three-
body bound states, one obtains

where the prefactor contains hΛtimes constant of order

Eq. (4.16) to obtain the trimer propagator. Again, ex-
actly in d= 4 the above expression for ⟨t†

the propagator of a free particle with the binding energy

V. TRIMER-DIMER-FERMION MIXTURE
The existence of shallow trimers changes the above-
described phase diagram of the Bose-Fermi mixture. In
particular, one should expect the emergence of the ther-
modynamically stable phase at densities below (3.7). The
coexistence of trimers, dimers, and unbound fermionic
atoms characterizes this phase. A simple analysis in di-
mensions close to d= 4 relying on the combinations of
bosonic and fermionic chemical potentials leads to the
conclusion that there can be no trimers without dimers
at least in the leading order of ϵexpansion. The ground
state energy of this three-component Fermi mixture of
almost non-interacting species can be written (up to an
unimportant overall dimensionless coefficient) as follows

with ncandntbeing densities of dimers and trimers, re-
spectively. Their equilibrium values are subject to mini-
mization of Ewith the natural constraint nb=nc+ 2nt
(all bosons gone for the formation of either dimers or
trimers). Thus, only one density (say nt) is unknown in
E, and solving equation ∂E/∂n t= 0 we find both ntand
nc. Then, it is easy to demonstrate that any of the so-
lutions realize a minimum of E(because ∂2E/∂n2
t>0).
Our calculations revealed that the trimers arise below

shifts the BEC transition (coinciding with the system’s

the trimers impact is always subleading in the k→ ∞
limit and is different [49] from the three-dimensional case
with the intrinsic Efimov physics. Equation (5.25) identi-
fies a linear in ϵterms of the two- and three-body contact
parameters. Finally, moving from high temperatures (of
course, T≪µf,c,t, but T > 0) we should expect, based
on previous analysis, the formation of the p-wave dimer-
trimer ( c−t) Cooper pairs (in addition to the above-
discussed fermion-dimer f−cones). Such a mixture then
is the two-component fermionic superfluid. To reveal the
variety of ground states of the system, however, one is
required to perform a more detailed investigation.
VI. SUMMARY AND OPEN QUESTIONS
In conclusion, we have studied the equilibrium prop-
erties of the strongly interacting Bose-Fermi mixture at
low temperatures close to four dimensions. Assuming no
interaction between bosonic atoms, we have argued that
there are several thermodynamically stable states of the
system without Bose-Einstein condensate. All bosons
in these states are coupled to fermions, and depending
on the density ratios of immersed fermions and bosons,7
form a macroscopic number of either dimers or dimers
and trimers at once (see Fig. 7). The latter two phases
are shown to be separated by the third-order quantum
phase transition. At lower densities of fermionic atoms,
the BEC transition occurs signaling the instability of the
fermion-dimer-trimer mixture. Once one can prove the
existence of the four-body (tetramers), five-body (pen-
tamers), and higher-order many-body bound states with
the binding energies ∼1
ma2, the system remains thermo-
dynamic at arbitrary compositions. Although it is impos-
sible to test these predictions experimentally, the Monte
Carlo simulations can resolve many of the problems set.
Slightly below d= 4, the thermodynamics of a sys-
tem can be calculated by means of the ϵ= 4−dex-
pansion. In particular, properties of the normal phase
were calculated (up to order ϵ) by utilizing the Fermi liq-
uid theory. At lower temperatures, the first superfluid
phase transition should be associated with the formationof the p-wave Cooper pairs of fermions and dimers. In
the same temperature scales the fermion-trimer pairs are
also predicted constituting the considered system as a
two-component superfluid. The peculiarities of the zero-
temperature phase diagram, even at small ϵs, are still
unknown and require further study.
Finally, we expect that much of the presented re-
sults concerning the behavior of this unrealistic near-
four-dimensional unitary Bose-Fermi mixtures should be
retained in two dimensions [50], especially at high densi-
ties.
