ABSTRACT  
The following laboratory procedure provides students with a hands -on experience in nanomaterials 
chemistry and characterization. This three -day protocol is easy to follow for undergraduates with basic 
chemistry or materials science backgrounds and is suita ble for inclusion in upper division courses in 
inorganic chemistry or materials science. Students use air -free chemistry procedures to synthesize 
and separate iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and subsequently modify the nanoparticle surface 
using a chemic al stripping agent. The morphology and chemical composition of the nanoparticles are 
characterized using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering measurements. Additionally, 
magnetic characterization  of the particles is performed  using a n open -source  (3D-printed), inexpensive 
magnetophotometer. Possible modifications to the synthe sis procedure including the incorporation of 
dopants to modify the magnetic response and alternative characterization techniques  are discussed . 
The three -day synthesis, pur ification, and characterization laboratory will prepare students with 
crucial skills for advanced technology industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, 
nanomedicine, and green chemistry.

INTRODUCTION  AND BACKGROUND  
In 2000, the National Nanotechnology Initiative was launched in the United States with four 
objectives designed to advance workforce training and technology development .1 Since then, the 
research community has made significant discoveries in nanotechnology research (first objective ). 
However, the development and sustainment of educational resources to support the creation of a 
skilled workforce (third objective ) has not received similar attention .2 As discussed in several 
longitudinal studies dating back to the mid -2000’s, many undergraduate and graduate chemistry and 
chemical engineering laboratory experiments have not been updated to include recent technical 
advances and modern instrumentation .3–5 In addition to decreasing the utility of the degrees, this also 
has resulted in increased attrition from Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics ( STEM ) 
degree programs .6 In this context, the development of nanomaterial synthesis laboratories provides a 
clear strategy to  increase  engage ment and retention in a wide range of degree programs.7 
There are several examples of inquiry -based undergraduate teaching laboratories exploring 
fundamental nanoengineering concepts8–11 and training students in various nano -characterization 
techniques.12,13 One family of nanomaterials commonly incorporated into teaching laboratories are 
optically -responsive nanoparticles , including gold nanoparticles14–18 and fluorescent quantum 
dots.11,19,20  While these materials serve as an ideal platform for exploring complex quantum concepts, 
  
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 3 of 15 such as the discretization of energy states21,22 and manipulation of light at the nanoscale ,23,24the 
notable  properties of these nanoparticles are limited to geometry and optical response. In contrast, 
nanomaterials can demonstrate a plethora of behaviors, including mechanical ,25optical ,2,23,24  
electrical ,26 chemical ,27 and more .28–31One unique nanomaterial is iron oxid e nanoparticles. Unlike 
quantum dots or metal nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles exhibit size - and shape -tunable 
magnetic behavior.27,32 –34 As a result of their magnetic response and low biotoxicity, this nanomaterial  
show s promise in a wide range of applications and fields , including biomedical devices and imaging, 
energy storage and generation, and chemical processing .28,31,35 –37 Thus, given their synergistic 
relationship to existing undergraduate nanoparticle laboratories  and their emerging real -world  
applications , the synthesis and characterization of iron oxide nanop articles  provide a rich foundation 
for integration into an academic laboratory course .38 
Iron oxide nanoparticles fall under a larger class of materials known as paramagnetic materials. 
Unlike many commonly available magnetic materials which rely on collective, long -range magnetic order 
to achieve an intrinsic magnetic response, paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials are considered 
nonmagnetic in the absence of an external magnetic field .39 However, in the presence of a field, their 
magnetic domains  align  in a single direction  (Figure 1 ), and the particle exhibits a magnetic response. The 
electron pairing determines if a material is diamagnetic or paramagnetic, which governs the sign of the 
magnetic susceptibility.  Symmetric or spherical iron oxide nanoparticles demonstrate a paramagnetic 
response due to their unpaired electrons and have a positive magnetic susceptibility .33 This response is 
governed by the material composition, crystallographic uniformity, and size. Indirectly, it is also 
controlled by the sample preparation, as clusters of particles behave differently from well -dispersed 
particles. Given the diversity of applications for paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, it is useful to 
measure their size, composition, and magnetic response  before pursuing an application .40–42

In prior work, several methods have been used to characterize these properties in iron oxide 
nanoparticles specifically. The methods and the ir generated data  are presented in Table 1. As can be 
observed, there are several options for measuring each parameter, depending on the availability of 
instrumentation. Additionally, depending on the method(s) selected, the results will be provided at 
either the single particle level or at the population level. This provides a unique opportunity to 
compare the differen ce between single particle and population -level data.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS  
The laboratory protocol is broken into 3 days: nanoparticle synthesis on Day 1, sample preparation 
and nanoparticle surface treatment on Day 2, and nanoparticle characterization on Day 3. A general 
  
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 5 of 15 overview is illustrated in Figure 2, and the detailed protocol is contained in the supplementary 
Instructor and Student  Manuals.  
 
Figure 2 . Overview of the full laboratory procedure. ( a-c) Day 1 consists of nanoparticle synthesis including ( a) the Fe 3O4 synthesis reaction, 
(b) isolating the iron oxide particles by centrifuge, and ( c) drying the iron oxide nanoparticles coated with oleylamine ligands. ( d-f) Day 2 
includes ( d) the stripping of nanoparticles by iodomethane ( MeI), (e) centrifugation to isolate the stripped iron oxide nanoparticles and ( f) 
drying the stripped Fe 3O4 nanoparticles.  (g-i) Characterization techniques used in Day 3 include ( g) magnetophotometry (MAP) using stripped 
nanoparticles, (h) Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using oleylamine coated nanoparticles, and (i) Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) using 
oleylamine coated nanoparticles . This figure was prepared using BioRender.  
 
Single -crystal metal nanoparticles formed via a two -part synthesis of nucleation and growth steps 
are well understood to produce monodisperse size distributions with strong shape control.52–56 The 
one-pot two -part synthesis used here follows a previously published procedure  with slight 
modifications to align with undergraduate laboratory expectations.57,58 Briefly, solid and liquid 
reagents are combined with the reaction solvent in an air -free environment (Figure 2a).59 Holding the 
reagents at an initial temperature of 200 C cleaves the acetylacetone bonds in Fe(acac) 3, allowing for 
nucleation of iron oxide sites. Further increasing the temperature until reflux, when particle growth is 
thermodynamically preferential, for a predetermined time leads to single crystal and highly 
monodisperse particles (Figure 2b).  
  
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 6 of 15 After purification, a subset of particles is further treated with iodomethane (MeI) to remove or 
‘strip’ the oleylamine ligands attached to the particle surface (Figure 2c). Samples are then prepared 
with the untreated and stripped particles (Figure 2d -f) to conduct size, shape, and magnetic response 
characterization (Figure 2g -i). This student cohort used dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM), and a n open -source m agnetophotometer (MAP)49 to analyze the particle 
size, shape, and magnetic response. Possible variations to the synthesis and alternative 
characterization methods are listed in Table 1 and are discussed  in more depth in the Instructor 
Manual.  
 
 
Hazards and Safety  
A concrete understanding of laboratory safety is essential for pursuit of modern careers in science 
and engineering. This laboratory procedure involves use of numerous hazardous chemicals and 
requires the use of appropriate mitigation measures . Before the start of the laboratory, all students 
received general laboratory safety training, which included instruction in proper handling of 
chemicals, personal protective equipment (PPE), mitigation measures (location and use of eye -wash 
stations, chemi cal showers , and fire extinguishers), and identification of chemicals by hazard type. 
During the laboratory, proper  PPE (high -temperature lab coat, goggles, and nitrile or heat -resistant 
gloves) was used in accordance with standard chemistry practices. All chemistry procedures were 
conducted in a fume hood to limit airborne exposure, and a trained laboratory  assistant was present 
throughout the procedure to assist when necessary.  Additional hazard information is included in the 
Instructor and Manual s. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Educational cohort  
A cohort of students from the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering with 
a minimum requirement of at least one semester equivalent of general chemistry volunteered to 
complete the lab to increase the diversity of their undergraduate research experiences. The students   
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 7 of 15 ranged from first -year through fourth -year undergraduates  pursuing a range of degree programs. All 
students had completed general laboratory safety training.  
Under the supervision of the  laboratory  assistant, the students worked in groups of 2 -3 over the 
course of the three -day lab, and each day was typically 3-4 hours. The experiments were designed to 
support inquiry -based learning by encouraging the students to discover the answers to a series of 
scientific questions each day as well as expand  their technical capabilities. These learning objectives 
can be summarized  as follows : 
1. Calculating the amount of reagents required using stoichiometric principles.  
2. Practicing commonly used  chemistry skills, including centrifugation.  
3. Introducing students to laboratory techniques related to air -sensitive chemistry, such as 
using a glove box and Schlenk line.  
4. Executing various sample preparation protocols.  
5. Learning and practicing nanomaterial characterization techniques.  
6. Applying theoretical knowledge of characterization techniques and assessing the 
characteristics of the synthesized nanoparticles.  
7. Developing data visualization and scientific communication skills.  
Because this laboratory introduced new techniques and skills, the students were instructed in the 
principles behind each  piece of equipment and executed the protocol themselves but were still closely 
monitored by a  laboratory  assistant at each step of the procedure (objectives 1 -3). After carrying out 
the synthesis, students prepared samples for characterization according to the instructions listed in 
the Student Manual  (objectives 4 -5). Students performed all data analysis  for subsequent discussion 
(object ives 6 -7). 
To assess if these learning objectives were achieved , the s tudent s’ understanding of the 
experimental  and scientific  principles was evaluated throughout the three days using diagnostic 
assessment, including pre -tests, and formative assessment, including passive and active observational 
techniques. For example, throughout the experiments, the  laboratory  assistant asked questions to 
assess understanding. The pre -tests and solutions as well as example questions are included in the 
supplementary documentation .   
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 8 of 15 Immediately following the conclusion  of the laboratory , a summative assessment was performed, 
which included both qualitative and quantitative components. Notably, 100% of the students felt that 
the lab experiment should be integrated as a required element into the undergraduate curriculum, 
and 100%  felt that they gained valuable skills and/or knowledge applicable outside of this lab session . 
This strong, positive response is notable given the students’ diverse academic backgrounds. However, 
the cohort had a mixed response when asked about the level of the rigor of the lab. Given the wide 
range in course preparation and academic levels, this response is not surprising. To address this 
possible shortcoming, several variations are included in the Instructor Ma nual to increase the 
complexity.  
In addition, a secondary reflective assessment was performed six months later. Upon reflection, the 
primary skills and knowledge imparted are the new data analysis methods and visualization 
techniques and the instrumentation methods. The students indicated  the value of these as they relate 
to their ongoing coursework and their intended future career paths. It is notable that this group of 
students have already found value in this new knowledge and anticipate or are already applying it 
across a diverse range  of fields, spanning from machine learning to therapeutics and biomedical 
engineering. This rapid impact highlights the relevance of this lab to an undergraduate engineering 
degree program. The entire assessment i s included in the Instructor Manual.  
 
Nanoparticle Characterization  
To confirm the suitability of the synthetic protocols and the proposed characterization methods for 
an undergraduate laboratory setting,  Figure 3 presents a series of results from nanoparticles prepared 
by the laboratory assistant and from particles prepared by a single student group . Both sets of 
particles are synthesized following the procedure  included in the Student Manual . Due to limitations 
in equipment access, the laboratory  assistant performed the DLS measurements, but the students 
took SEM images and performed magnetic response testing with a MAP themselves. The students 
performed all sample preparation and data analysis . For all data sets in Figure 3, the results from the 
student group agreed with those from the laboratory assistant, demonstrating the robustness of the 
synthetic method.    
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 9 of 15 The combination of SEM and DLS data provide s an opportunity to analyze particle size at both the 
single particle and ensemble level. Based on published work by Sun  et al. , we anticipate the particle 
size to be between 10 -15 nm.57 Each group prepared samples and acquired SEM images of their own 
batch of nanoparticles as seen in Figure 3 a. Notably, the image  show s particle clumps in the 100  nm 
range and individual particles are not clearly resolved  (Figure 3a) . For the particles  synthesized by the 
laboratory assistant , the diameter determined from SEM images is in the 15 nm range  (Figure 3 b). The 
DLS data reveals similar particle sizes, diameters of 12 nm, for both the  student and the  laboratory 
assistant samples (Figure 3 c-d). Lastly , students  confirmed the paramagnetic response of the particles  
using a custom Magnetophotometer (MAP) system  (Figure 3 e-f). As can be observed  in Figure 3 e and 
3f, the particles synthesized by either the students or the laboratory assistant exhibit a clear positive 
magnetic response when in the presence of the permanent magnetic, indicating a positive magnetic 
susceptibility value.

particles made by graduate assistant are shown in panes ( b), (d), and (f). 
 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  
In summary, we have detailed a research -based, three -day, advanced undergraduate laboratory 
protocol which includes the synthesis of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, modification of the surface 
coating, and characterization of the  particle properties . The experiments can easily be modified based 
on available equipment . They are designed to combine principles from chemistry, materials science, 
and physics to expose students to interdisciplinary research and modern instrumentation  while 
utilizing inexpensive reagents  and commonly accessible characterization techniques . They also serve 
as a bridge, connecting seemingly disparate coursework. While this 3 -day laboratory experiment was 
  
Journal of Chemical Education  9/18/22  Page 11 of 15 piloted with a cohort of undergraduate students, it could also be suitable for a graduate student 
experimental methods course.
