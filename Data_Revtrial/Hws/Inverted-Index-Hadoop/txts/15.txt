ABSTRACT
Noticing the potential relationship between the pulsation amplitude of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and
their average effective temperatures, we derived the relation between them from observational data. Using these
relationships, we present the zero-age horizontal branch lines and corresponding evolutionary tracks in the Bailey
diagrams. We first find that the trends of zero-age horizontal branch lines are consistent with the distributions of
Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars, and there is a period shift effect in relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] >-1). Main
results show that evolutionary effects are the direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. The vast majority of Oosterhoff
I RR Lyrae stars are in the early stage of horizontal branch evolution, while most of the Oosterhoff II stars are near
the end of the horizontal branch phase. Our Bailey diagrams can intuitively explain some Oosterhoff phenomena (e.g.,
long-period RR Lyrae stars in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441), and also have the potential
to become an important tool for in-depth study of RR Lyrae stars. Further research is needed on the Oosterhoff
dichotomy to explore the formations and evolutionary processes of the Milky Way and its substructures.

1.INTRODUCTION
RR Lyrae stars are a type of short period pulsating variables widely distributed in various celestial systems within
the Milky Way. They are old, small mass stars in the evolutionary stage of the horizontal branch (HB), generally
believed to be over 10 billion years old. Therefore, they are one of the important probes for studying the structure
and evolution of the Milky Way and neighboring galaxies (Smith 2004). Single mode RR Lyrae stars can be divided
into two types: the ab-type (RRab stars) and the c-type (RRc stars). The former are dominated by the fundamental
mode, while the latter are dominated by the first overtone mode with a relatively short pulsation period. In the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram), RR Lyrae stars, as those horizontal branch stars, also undergo evolution
over time. For a metal-intermediate RR Lyrae star, it begins its evolution from the zero-age horizontal branch (ZAHB),
first evolves from blue to red, then in the opposite direction, and finally turns towards the asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) located in the upper right corner of the HR diagram (Bono et al. 2020). The typical lifetime of a horizontal
branch star is generally 0.1 Gyr, and it may only spend a portion of its life in the Instability Strip (IS, Sandage 1957;
Lee 1991; Pietrinferni et al. 2004; Le Borgne et al. 2007). In this process, the physical parameters of the stars such
as luminosity, and effective temperature change with evolution. Consequently, the pulsation parameters, which are
dependent on these physical parameters (e.g., period, amplitude), will also undergo changes (Di Criscienzo et al. 2004;
Le Borgne et al. 2007).
RR Lyrae stars were first discovered in globular clusters (GCs), and the observation and research of such stars were
initially mostly focused on those in GCs (Smith 2004). One of the important discoveries was the Oosterhoff dichotomy.
This phenomenon refers to significant differences in the average pulsation period distribution and the proportion of
RRc stars to the total number of RR Lyrae stars in different GCs (Oosterhoff 1939). The clusters with short periods
and low proportions (i.e., M3) are known as Oosterhoff type I clusters (OoI clusters), while those with long periods
and high proportions (i.e., M15) are known as Oosterhoff type II clusters (OoII clusters, Smith 2004). It was later
discovered that the metallicity of stars in the OoII clusters were weaker than that of stars in the OoI clusters (Arp 1955;
Kinman 1959). Numerous studies have been conducted to explain the Oosterhoff phenomenon. Interested readers can
refer to Smith (2004) and recent papers such as Fabrizio et al. (2021) and Zhang et al. (2023).
In the present paper, we focus on the relevant work conducted from the evolutionary perspective. Sandage (1958)
suggested that OoII RR Lyrae stars are brighter than those in OoI GCs. Subsequently, Sandage et al. (1981) discovered
the period shift effect based on observations of the RR Lyrae stars in GCs M3 and M15. In subsequent work, Sandage
(1981a) and Sandage (1982) pointed out that this effect exists in other GCs and has a general correlation with metal
abundance. In a series of Sandages works, the Oosterhoff phenomenon and period shift effect are primarily explained
by an increase in luminosity with decreasing metallicity. However, the evolutionary factors have also been mentioned
in Sandage (1981b). Actually, the evolutionary effect has also been noted by some other scholars (van Albada & Baker
1973; Gratton et al. 1986; Caputo & de Santis 1992), but the first literature that explicitly connects the Oosterhoff
phenomenon to evolutionary effects should be Lee et al. (1990). Based on their calculations, they pointed out that
”almost all of the RR Lyrae variables in group II clusters are highly evolved stars from the blue side of the instability
strip” and ”calculations for group I clusters like M3 indicate that the masses and luminosities of the RR Lyrae variables
are not much different from those of the ZAHB models”. The viewpoints that evolution is related to the Oosterhoff
dichotomy are also supported by models and observations (Caputo & de Santis 1992; Cox 1995; Clement & Shelton
1999; Lee & Carney 1999; Cacciari et al. 2005; Prudil et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2023).
In recent decades, with the development of multiple photometric surveys, the number of discovered RR Lyrae stars
in the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies has also rapidly increased (Alcock et al. 1998; Ivezi´ c et al. 2000; Vivas
et al. 2004; Kinemuchi et al. 2006; Szczygie l & Fabrycky 2007; Soszy´ nski et al. 2014, 2016, 2019; Clementini et al. 2019,
2023; Moln´ ar et al. 2022). In the study of these objects, the Bailey diagrams (Bailey et al. 1919), also known as the
Ppul- Amplitude diagram, are usually used to investigate the Oosterhoff phenomenon (Kinemuchi et al. 2006; Kunder
& Chaboyer 2009; Szczygie l et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2011; Bono et al. 2020). The latest studies utilize spectral data
to determine metal abundance and kinetic parameters, and combine the Bailey diagram to analyze the Oosterhoff
dichotomy (Fabrizio et al. 2019, 2021; Zhang et al. 2023). The two pulsation parameters in the Bailey diagram,
pulsation period Ppuland amplitude, are independent of distance and reddening, and are related to the physical and
evolutionary parameters of stars. The relationship between the pulsation period and these parameters is well-known
(van Albada & Baker 1971). If we establish the relationship between amplitude and these parameters (or a specific
parameter), we can plot the evolutionary tracks on the Bailey diagram, similar to the HR diagram, and compare them
with the observational results. In fact, this approach has appeared in previous studies (Bono et al. 1997, 2020).Bailey Diagrams 3
In Section 2, we utilize the data from the LAMOST low-resolution spectrum (Xiang et al. 2019) and Gaia DR3 (Gaia
Collaboration 2022; Clementini et al. 2023) to establish the relationship between effective temperature ( Teff) and the
amplitude of the G band ( A(G)). In Section 3, we utilize the relationships between pulsation parameters and physical
parameters to derive the pulsation parameters of RR Lyrae stars under various horizontal branching states, and then
depict the ZAHB and evolutionary tracks in the Bailey diagram. Sections 4 and 5 are the discussion and conclusion,
respectively.
2.RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEFFAND A(G)
Given the structural evolution parameters (mass, [Fe/H], Teff, luminosity, etc.) of a horizontal branch star in the IS,
its pulsation period can be obtained by using the equation provided by van Albada & Baker (1971):
logPpul= 11.497−0.68 logM
M⊙+ 0.84 logL
L⊙−3.48 log Teff. (1)
Therefore, all we need to do is find the correlation between the pulsation amplitude and these evolutionary parameters.
Sandage (1981b) pointed out that the Bband amplitude A(B) is neither a function of luminosity nor of [Fe/H], but
depends principally on Teffalone. Bono et al. (1997) used a nonlinear convection model to conduct theoretical research.
The studies revealed that the luminosity amplitude is closely related to the Teff, and the dependence on stellar mass
and metal abundance can be ignored. McNamara & Barnes (2014) also pointed out that the dependence of the light
amplitude of RR Lyrae stars on temperature is independent of Oosterhoff type. They provided the equations for the
relationships between the intrinsic color index ( B−V)0and the amplitudes of BandVbands, which can be used to
determine interstellar reddening. Based on the these literature, we assume that the average effective temperature is
the only variable in the amplitude function and use the observational results to establish the relationship between the
two parameters.
TheTeffdata come from Xiang et al. (2019), while the amplitude data we adopted are the G band amplitude
A(G) provided by Gaia DR3. Xiang et al. (2019) analyzed the LAMOST low-resolution spectra, providing multiple
elemental abundance data for 6 million stars, as well as corresponding atmospheric physical parameters such as Teff,
[Fe/H], and surface gravity log g. In the present paper, we use the Teffdata provided in their work. In fact, the data
obtained from the LAMOST spectrum have been successfully applied to RR Lyrae stars and related fields (Li et al.
2020; Liu et al. 2020, 2022; Duan et al. 2021a,b; Wang et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2023; Cabrera Garcia et al. 2024).
Using the xmatch tool from the CDS website1(Boch et al. 2012; Pineau et al. 2020), we cross-referenced the catalog
provided by Xiang et al. (2019) with the Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae variable catalog (Gaia Collaboration 2022; Clementini
et al. 2023) and obtained 4550 consistent results. After removing the results with Teffless than 5500 K, errors of Teff
greater than 500 K, and A(G) greater than 1.3 mag, we finally obtained 4071 results (depicted as light gray dots in
Figure 1). The observation of LAMOST can be regarded as a random sampling of the objects. Due to the asymmetry
of the RRab variation curves, most of the sampling corresponds to phases with low luminosity, which corresponds to
low temperature during the pulsation phase 0.5 - 0.8. It is shown in Figure 1 that most data points are concentrated
in the temperature range of 6000 - 6450 K. It can also be observed that the temperature distribution range is widest
with a large amplitude, and the highest temperature can exceed 8000 K. This supports the perspective of Sandage
(1981b) that ”amplitude is a unique function of depth of penetration into the instability strip.”
We use a simple and crude method to obtain the relationship between amplitude and Teff. We divide multiple regions
at equal intervals between A(G) of 0.1 - 1.3 mag, and calculate the arithmetic means of the TeffandA(G) for each
region. The results are highlighted with black dots in Figure 1. Furthermore, we use a parabola to fit the data points
and establish the relationship between A(G) and log Teff(represented by the red line in Figure 1):
A(G) = −4030(1340) + 2083(700) ·log T eff−269.1(91.7)·(log T eff)2. (2)
The typical exposure times for LAMOST low-resolution spectra range from tens of minutes to over an hour (Luo et al.
2019). Due to the long exposure times, the actual temperatures obtained near phase 0 should be lower than the true
instantaneous maximum temperatures. It can be inferred that the average Teffin Figure 1 is slightly underestimated.
However, the Blazhko effect can also lead to an overestimation of Teffby affecting the amplitude. The Blazhko
1http://cdsxmatch.u-strasbg.fr/4 Li et al.
phenomenon is mainly characterized by periodic or quasi-periodic changes in the amplitude and phase of the light
curve of RR Lyrae stars, which was first noticed by Blaˇ zko (1907). It is generally believed that the existence of the
Blazhko effect suppresses pulsation, leading to a decrease in pulsation amplitude (Smith 2004), but has a relatively
small impact on the average temperature (Jurcsik et al. 2012). Therefore, the Blazhko effect can cause some originally
high-temperature objects to appear in low-amplitude regions, leading to overestimates of the average Teff.
In fact, we can use the information provided by Bono et al. (1997) and McNamara & Barnes (2014) to establish the
relationship between A(G) and Teff. The log TeffandA(B) of fundamental mode pulsators are provided in Tables 3
and 4 of Bono et al. (1997). Just convert the A(B) toA(G)2, and we can obtain the relationship (see green and blue
pecked lines in Figure 1). Similarly, using the Equations (3, 5, 7) provided by McNamara & Barnes (2014), along with
the amplitude conversion formulas for different bands, we derived the relationship between A(G) and Teff(refer to the
green and blue dashed lines in Figure 1). It can be seen that there are differences in the relationship trends derived
from the two literatures, and our results fall exactly between their distributions. This suggests that our results are
reasonable. According to Equation (2), when the minimum A(G) is 0.1 mag and the maximum A(G) is 1.3 mag, the
corresponding average Teffis 6250 K and 6900 K, respectively. This indicates that the width of the fundamental mode
IS is about 650 K.
3.BAILEY DIAGRAM
After understanding the relationship between pulsation parameters and evolutionary parameters, our focus now shifts
to obtaining the evolutionary parameters of HB stars. In the present paper, we use the theoretical model parameters
provided by Dorman (1992). This oxygen-enhanced model provided the HB evolution sequences of a large grid, in which
the partial mixing has been accurately calculated during most of the evolution. It may be more suitable for stars in
GCs than scaled-solar models. Dorman (1992) provided detailed ZAHB sequences at different metal abundances, and
calculated the evolutionary sequences for 10-13 masses for each composition. The entire computational grid consists of
115 sequences and approximately 40,000 stellar models, each with corresponding parameters including [Fe/H], oxygen
to iron abundance [O/Fe], helium abundance Y, post-helium-flash age, mass, luminosity, Teff, logg, absolute magnitude
inVband, color index B−V, etc. When the evolution is in the instability strip, Dorman (1992) also provides the
mass-to-light parameter and log Ppul. We are also concerned about parameters located in and near IS, but the amount
of data provided by Dorman (1992) in this region is limited. Therefore, we assume that the evolutionary tracks are
continuous and smooth (ignoring the possible loops and spikes during the evolution), and use the evolution parameters
(mass, luminosity, and Teff) in and near the IS as the fitting objects. We use linear polynomials or exponential decay
as fitting formulas to obtain the Mass - Teffand Luminosity - Teffrelationships of ZAHB and evolutionary tracks in
this region. These relationship are utilized to determine the mass and luminosity, and subsequently calculate the Ppul.
In this way, we can plot continuous evolutionary tracks in IS. Then, based on Equation (2) and the pulsation relation
of van Albada & Baker (1971), these sequences can be plotted on the Bailey diagram.
3.1. ZAHB in Bailey Diagram
In the left panel of Figure 2, the solid lines display the ZAHB for different [Fe/H] on the Bailey diagram. As a
comparison, we also provide the color density map of the Gaia DR3 RRab sample. The contour lines, marked by
dashed lines, display isodensity levels in increments of 100. The right panel of Figure 2 shows the ZAHB HR diagram
near the IS (rotated 90 degrees for comparison with the left panel). The solid dots were provided by Dorman (1992),
while the solid lines represent the corresponding smooth curves. The red and blue dashed horizontal lines indicate
theTeffof 6250 K and 6900 K, respectively. These values represent the red and blue edges of the RRab stars in the
present paper. For a single ZAHB line, the masses decrease with an increase in Teff(i.e., with an increase in pulsation
amplitude). However, there is a significant difference in the masses of ZAHB pulsating stars with different [Fe/H], and
the masses decrease with the increase of [Fe/H]. The average mass of the stars with the lowest [Fe/H] in our samples
is about 0.71 M⊙, while the average mass of the stars with the highest [Fe/H] is only 0.57 M⊙.
It can be seen from the left panel of Figure 2 that the density map mainly reflects the distribution of OoI-type
stars, which account for the majority of RRab stars, while the ZAHB lines follow the relationship between the period
and amplitude of OoI stars. However, there is a slight deviation between solid lines and the highest concentration.
2In practical operation, we first covert A(B) toA(V), and then to A(G). The formulas used are A(V) = 0.00653 + 0.75896 A(B) and
A(G) = 0.925 A(V) - 0.012. The former is obtained by linear fitting using data from Table 6 of Liu & Janes (1990), and the latter is the
Equation (3) of Clementini et al. (2016).Bailey Diagrams 5
It is easy to understand that, similar to how most main sequence stars are positioned higher than the zero-age main
sequence in the HR diagram, most OoI stars are in the ”main sequence stage” of the HB. They exhibit a slightly
higher degree of evolution than the ZAHB, and are consequently situated to the right of the ZAHB lines in the Bailey
diagram. In addition, it can be observed that when [Fe/H] <-1, the distribution of solid lines with different [Fe/H]
is not significantly different. However, when [Fe/H] >-1, as the [Fe/H] increases, the lines move towards the left of
the diagram, exhibiting the period shifting effect mentioned by A. Sandage. The reason for this phenomenon may be
derived from the pulsation relation of van Albada & Baker (1971). In the right panel of Figure 2, it can be clearly seen
that the luminosity of metal-poor ZAHB stars in the IS is higher than that of metal-rich stars. However, according to
the pulsation relation of van Albada & Baker (1971), the pulsation period is not only proportional to the logarithm of
luminosity, but also inversely proportional to the logarithm of mass. Therefore, for stars with [Fe/H] <-1, as [Fe/H]
decreases, both their luminosities and masses increase. The impact of the two parameters is offset, and the pulsation
periods are not significantly affected. However, for stars with [Fe/H] >-1, the luminosity difference between stars
with different [Fe/H] increases, leading to significant differences in Ppul. Finally, Figure 2 indicates that most OoI-type
stars are HB stars either on or just evolved from the ZAHB.
3.2. Evolutionary tracks in Bailey Diagram
Similarly, we present the evolutionary tracks of HB stars with different [Fe/H] in the Bailey diagrams (Figures 3 and
4). The black dashed lines in each panel represent the ZAHB of the corresponding [Fe/H]. The solid lines with different
colors represent the evolution of stars with varying masses. The gray background dots represent RRab samples from
Gaia DR3, while the black solid dots represent field RRab stars with [Fe/H] similar to the values listed in individual
panels (data provided by Liu et al. 2020). The red solid dots represent RRab stars in GCs (Clement et al. 2001; Clement
2017). According to the [Fe/H] of their host clusters, they are plotted in the corresponding panels. Specifically, the
samples come from M15, M53, M3, M62, M4, M107, NGC 6388, and NGC 6441. The corresponding mean [Fe/H] are
as follow: [Fe/H] = -2.3 (Carretta et al. 2009; VandenBerg et al. 2016; Bhardwaj et al. 2021a), -2.06 (Harris 2010;
Boberg et al. 2016; Bhardwaj et al. 2021b), -1.5 (Harris 2010; Bhardwaj et al. 2020), -1.3 (Contreras et al. 2010), -1.1
(Braga et al. 2015; Neeley et al. 2015), -0.82 (Butler 1975), -0.60 (Armandroff & Zinn 1988), and -0.53 (Armandroff
& Zinn 1988).
Figures 3 and 4 show rich information and details. The several evolutionary tracks on the right side of each panel
represent the late stage of HB (i.e., evolving toward AGBs), with the evolution direction from the top left to the
bottom right. Their positions are consistent with those of the OoII group. In addition, it can be observed that under
the same [Fe/H], the evolutionary tracks with lower masses tend to be more to the right, while the track with the
highest mass tends to be more to the left, even in the Oosterhoff intermediate region (Fabrizio et al. 2019). In the
OoI region, the evolutionary tracks are relatively complex. The evolutions of HB stars near the IS are as follow: first,
they move slightly from ZAHB toward the red, then toward the blue (the first turning point), and finally toward
the AGB with higher luminosity (the second turning point). The folding lines in the OoI region in Figure 3 and 4
represent the corresponding evolutionary turning points. Taking Panel a in Figure 3 as an example, the purple upward
curve represents the first turning point, while the right purple line represents the track after the second turning point;
and the yellow downward curve represents the second turning point. In addition, the evolution lines between the two
turning points are also shown in the panels (the purple line on the left in Panel b, green lines on the left in Panel c
and d, red line on the left in Panel e, and black line on the left in Panel f), and they evolve along the ZAHB toward
the upper left, in line with the distribution of OoI stars.
From the above, we speculate that the vast majority of OoI stars are HB stars in the early stage of HB evolution
(before the second turning point), while most of OoII stars are in the late stage. Some stars in the Oo Intermediate
loci may be massive evolved targets under the same [Fe/H] conditions. From the observed results, it can be seen that
there is indeed a significant difference in the [Fe/H] between OoI and OoII stars (Fabrizio et al. 2019, 2021; Zhang et al.
2023, and references therein). However, in different panels, both OoI and OoII types of samples exist simultaneously,
with varying proportions of quantities. This phenomenon of coexisting at different [Fe/H] scales suggests that the
main mechanism leading to the Oosterhoff dichotomy should be evolutionary effect. Of course, we do not easily deny
the influence of other factors, and we will provide a brief discussion in Section 4.
Figure 4 shows the evolutionary tracks of RRab stars with relatively high [Fe/H]. They have features similar to that
in Figure 3. Additionally, a rapid decrease in the sample size can be observed. But this reduction should be caused by
observation effects and data processing strategies. The majority of the data in Liu et al. (2020) was obtained from the6 Li et al.
LAMOST survey, focusing on halo stars rather than targets in the Galactic disk and bulge. Additionally, in their data
processing, the matching template used also imposes limitations on [Fe/H]. It can be inferred that there are more RR
Lyrae stars with [Fe/H] >-1, and most of them are located in the disk and bulge. Moreover, Panels c and d in Figure
4 show that the RRab stars found in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441, which are rich in [Fe/H] and have long Ppul(known
as the OoIII group, Pritzl et al. 2000; Catelan 2009), are stars in the late stage of HB with relatively small masses.
3.3. Summary
Based on the information provided, we summarize four cases of the evolution of RRab stars in the Bailey diagram.
When the [Fe/H] is constant, HB stars with lower mass (e.g., [Fe/H]= -1.66, Mass = 0.62 M⊙, Panel d of Figure 3)
tend to have higher Teffin the early stages of evolution, and only remain in the fundamental mode IS in the later
stages. They only appear in the OoII region (Case I, see the black line in Panel d of Figure 3). The slightly higher
mass stars (0.64 M⊙) are in the IS during the early stages (the first turning point) and later stages (after the second
turning point), and are located in the OoI and OoII regions, respectively (Case II, see the red lines in Panel d of Figure
3). The larger mass stars (0.66 M⊙) only present in the IS during the blueward and second redward stages, and are
located in the OoI and OoII regions respectively (Case III, see the green lines in Panel d of Figure 3). The stars with
the highest masses (0.68 M⊙) may only be in IS during the second turning point stages, and will be in the OoI or Oo
Intermediate loci (Case IV, see the blue line in Panel d of Figure 3).
4.DISCUSSIONS
As mentioned in Section 1, the practice of plotting evolutionary tracks in Bailey diagrams have already appeared
in Bono et al. (1997) and Bono et al. (2020). Compared to their results, the main difference between us and them is
the masses. At the same metal abundance, Bono et al. (1997) systematically used a higher mass than in our study.
The same applies to the example of metal-poor samples in Bono et al. (2020). The reason for this deviation should
be attributed to the theoretical model. Different models have various parameters and conditions, such as [O/Fe] and
helium abundance, leading to distinct evolutionary paths. However, the overall shapes of the tracks will not be altered.
For example, without considering the difference in masses, the track shapes in Figures 16 and 17 of Bono et al. (1997)
are generally consistent with our results shown in Panels a and e of Figure 3. The main difference is that the ZAHB
line in their Figure 17 is positioned further to the right compared to ours. In the case of Z = 0.0001 ([Fe/H] = -2.3)
as reported by Bono et al. (2020), the mass used was relatively large, is 0.75 M⊙, and the corresponding temperature
at the ZAHB was also high, is log Teff∼3.91 (approximately 8130 K, refer to the upper-left panel of their Figure
4). The evolutionary tracks in their Bailey diagram (middle-left panel of Figure 4 in their paper) are consistent with
our Case I. Bono et al. (2020) provided several examples of evolution, with only one mass condition specified for each
metal abundance. Normally, the mass distribution of RR Lyrae stars in GCs should follow a certain pattern, and
relying on just one evolutionary track is insufficient. Similar work has been done by Sandage (2010), but they adopted
the same approach, where each GC only has one evolutionary track. As for determining which model is better, it still
needs to be based on the observational results in the Bailey diagram. As introduced in Section 3, Figures 3 and 4
are sufficient to describe the evolution of RRab stars in the Bailey diagram. The theoretical tracks align well with
observational results, and can elucidate some phenomena that were previously challenging to explain. This paper
also introduces a new research approach. Future scholars can establish more detailed theoretical models, construct
more accurate evolutionary trajectories, and conduct more in-depth research on the specifics in the Bailey diagram,
such as the HASP (Stetson et al. 2014; Fiorentino et al. 2015; Belokurov et al. 2018), and the different populations
(Pietrukowicz et al. 2015, 2020).
One of our works is to establish the relationship between the amplitude of RRab stars and their average Teff. The
primary analysis is also centered around this relationship. In fact, the relationship between pulsation amplitude and
other parameters is also a topic worthy of further research. In the present paper, we simply assume that the amplitude
is only related to the Teff. However, some scholars suggest that other factors may have an impact or correlation on
the amplitude. Lee et al. (1990) proposed that the amplitude is not solely related to temperature, but also depends
on [Fe/H]. The relationships depicted in literature also indicate that the amplitude is not only correlated with the
color index, but also with [Fe/H] and/or pulsation period (Caputo & de Santis 1992; Piersimoni et al. 2002; Kunder &
Chaboyer 2009). The amplitude is believed to be related to the Oosterhoff type (Clement & Shelton 1999), but there is
also an opposing view (McNamara & Barnes 2014). In recent years, researches on RR Lyrae stars using spectral data
provided by various survey projects have mostly focused on parameters such as element abundance and radial velocityBailey Diagrams 7
(see series of papers of Fabrizio et al. 2019 and Liu et al. 2020). However, there is a lack of relevant analysis on other
physical parameters (e.g., Teff, log g). Perhaps scholars can directly obtain these parameters in different pulsation
phases through spectroscopy, and then obtain the average values. These averages can be compared with physical and
pulsation parameters to identify specific statistical rules and correlations. Of course, similar work can also be done by
using the photometric color index (Ngeow et al. 2017). However, eliminating the influence of interstellar extinction is
a complex problem.
The viewpoint that the Oosterhoff dichotomy is caused by evolutionary effects does not necessarily negate other
viewpoints and discoveries. There may be complex factors and causes behind a phenomenon. As mentioned earlier, the
evolutionary effect itself involves multiple stellar physical and evolutionary parameters, including metal abundance,
mass, age, etc. The differences in physical and dynamic parameters between OoI and OoII RR Lyrae stars are
understandable and have been confirmed (Fabrizio et al. 2019, 2021; Iorio & Belokurov 2021; Liu et al. 2022; Zhang
et al. 2023). Of course, the most relevant parameters for evolution should be the two ages: the age starting from
the ZAHB (or post-helium-flash age) and the age starting from the zero-age main sequence. The former directly
determines the evolutionary stage of HB stars, while the latter involves the formation and evolution of stars in specific
celestial structures such as the Galactic bulge, disk, halo, GCs, and dwarf galaxies. Different evolutionary experiences
of the structures have also led to various scenarios in the Bailey diagram. Broadly speaking, we concur with Zhang
et al. (2023) perspective that ”Oosterhoff dichotomy is the result of a combination of stellar and galactic evolution.”
Conversely, a deeper understanding of the Oosterhoff phenomenon may contribute to the study of the formation and
evolution of galactic substructures (Fiorentino et al. 2015; Pietrukowicz et al. 2015; Belokurov et al. 2018; Prudil et al.
2019, 2020; Pietrukowicz et al. 2020; Zinn et al. 2020; Iorio & Belokurov 2021; Liu et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022).
5.CONCLUSION
The mechanism behind the Oosterhoff dichotomy is an important open question in the research field of RR Lyrae
stars, and the evolutionary effect is one of the frequently mentioned explanations. Noting the relationships between
the pulsation parameters of pulsating stars and their evolutionary parameters, we have discovered that it is possible to
create an ”HR diagram” with pulsation parameters as variables. This allows us to construct the evolutionary tracks
in the Bailey diagrams. We assumed that the pulsation amplitude is a function of the average Teff, and derived their
relationship equation from the observed data. Based on these relationships, we convert the evolutionary parameters
presented by Dorman (1992) into corresponding pulsation parameters, and illustrate them on the Bailey diagram (see
Figures 2, 3, 4).
Figure 2 shows that the distributions of the ZAHB RRab stars are consistent with those of OoI stars, both decreasing
with the increase of Ppul. When [Fe/H] <-1, there is little difference in the distribution of ZAHB lines for different
[Fe/H]. When [Fe/H] >-1, the difference in luminosity caused by [Fe/H] becomes significant, leading to the period
shift phenomenon in the Bailey diagram (left panel of Figure 2). The evolutionary tracks in Figures 3 and 4 suggest
that the vast majority of OoI stars are HB stars in the early stage of HB evolution, while most of OoII stars are in the
late stage. Some stars in the Oo Intermediate loci may be massive evolved targets under the same [Fe/H] conditions.
These indicate that evolutionary effects are the direct cause of the Oo dichotomy. Our Bailey diagrams also intuitively
solve the problem of the so-called OoIII groups with rich [Fe/H] and long Ppul, and have broader application prospects.
Finally, research on the Oosterhoff phenomenon will not be interrupted. Reflecting the results of HB evolution can
play an important role as a clue or breakthrough point in exploring the formation and evolution process of the Milky
Way and its substructures.
