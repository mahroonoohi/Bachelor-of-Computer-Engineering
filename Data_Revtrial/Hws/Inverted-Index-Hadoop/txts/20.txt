We consider interstellar light transmission aided by a grav itational lens. We ﬁnd that optimal
reception eﬃciency occurs in lensing geometries where the t ransmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly
aligned. We explore various signal detection strategies, e mploying both existing and emerging
technologies. With this study, our understanding of inters tellar power transmission via gravitational
lensing has signiﬁcantly progressed. We observe that detec tion signals from nearby stars, may
leverage established photonics and optical engineering te chnologies, and networks of collaborative
astronomical facilities. Our ﬁndings support the feasibil ity of interstellar power transmission via
gravitational lensing, directly contributing to the ongoi ng optical SETI eﬀorts.
I. INTRODUCTION
Interstellar power transmission is very challenging. Even for a collima ted laser beam, the large distances involved
result in a very small energy received. Consider, a diﬀraction-limited telescope with aperture dtyielding the beam
divergence of θ0≃λ/dt= 1.00×10−6(λ/1µm)(1m/dt). When the signal reaches the receiver at distance z, the
beam is expanded to a spot with the radius of ρ∗≃z(λ/dt)≃3.09×1011m (z/10pc)(λ/1µm)(1m/dt). As a result,
in the case of a free-space laser power transmission in the vacuum, a telescope with the aperture drreceives only a
small fraction of the transmit power PTgiven asPR=PTπ(1

both 1) precise and stable transmitter pointing toward us to within ρL/z≃fewµrad and 2) us having instruments
capable of detecting such signals against the challenging optical bac kgrounds present in our stellar neighborhood.
Therefore, unless there is a signiﬁcant eﬀort to send us a message using a powerful, focused beam directly aimed
at us, detecting faint and transient signals with optical SETI1remains extremely challenging.
The situation changes if a transmitter is placed in the focal region of a stellar gravitational lens to beneﬁt from the
lens’ signiﬁcant light ampliﬁcation. Lensing geometries where the light source, the lens, and the receiver are in an
approximatealignmentmaximize eﬃciency ofthe interstellarcommunic ationlinks [1]. Given ourcurrenttechnological
maturity, we cannot yet position a transmitter in the focal region o f the solar gravitational lens. However, we now
begun to understand the physics of the interstellar power transm ission facilitated by gravitational lensing and are in
a position to devise practical strategies to search for the signals o riginated around nearby stars. These eﬀorts can rely
on the already existing technologies, bringing this topic in the realm of advanced photonics and optical engineering.
This paper is organized as follows: In Section II, we present the wav e-theoretical tools to describe light propagation
in a gravity ﬁeld. We discuss power transmission via a gravitational len s, introduce major noise sources, and evaluate
detection sensitivity. In Section IV we discuss detection strategie s. Our conclusions are presented in Section V.
II. EM WAVES IN A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
We consider a nearby star with mass ML, radiusRL, and its Schwarzschild radius of rg= 2GML/c2. We assume
that an optical transmitter is placed in the focal region of this stella r gravitational lens at a distance z0>R2
L/2rg=
547.8(RL/R⊙)2(M⊙/ML) AU from it.
We further assume that a CW laser optical transmitter is facing the lens and is capable of coherently illuminating
an annular area around the lens with the radius of b=/radicalbig2rgz0> RL(see details in [1]). To do that, a diﬀraction-
limited transmitter will have to form an annular beam of light with the me an diverging angle of b/z0=/radicalbig
2rg/z0≃
7.16×10−6(b/RL)(RL/R⊙)(650AU/z0) rad and pointed toward the receiver behind the lens (see Fig.1).

FIG. 1: Beam propagation in a thin lens approximation showin g transmitter, lens, annulus, and receiver plane.
When electromagnetic (EM) waves travel in the vicinity of the lens, it s gravity causes the waves to scatter and
diﬀract [2, 3]. As a result, after passing by the lens and at a larger dis tance from it, z≫z0, the beam will be
compressed and nearly collimated by the lens’ spherical aberration . If properly designed, the transmitted light will
be deposited in the solar system. A solar system observer, looking b ack at the lensing star, will see the transmitted
signal in the form of the Einstein ring. This focusing results in a major increase in the power density of the EM ﬁeld
deposited at the observer’s telescope (see discussion in [1]). Below w e consider the physics of this eﬀect.
A. Light ampliﬁcation
We introduce a lens-centric cylindrical coordinate system ( ρ,φ,z) with itsz-axis oriented along the unperturbed
direction of the incident wave’s propagation (see Fig. 2), given by a u nit vector k. We also introduce a light ray’s
impact parameter, b, withb⊥k. In this coordinate system, the transmitter is positioned at (0 ,−z0), while the
receiver is on the plane with coordinates ( x,z) and
b=b(cosφξ,sinφξ,0),x=ρ(cosφ,sinφ,0). (2)
Assuming validity of the eikonal and the thin lens approximations, and considering a uniform surface brightness of
the source, the Fresnel-Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction formula [4, 5] yields t he following expression for the wave’s amplitude at
the observer (receiver) location

at (0,−z0) to the observer’s position at ( x,z) via a point ( b,0) on the lens plane (see Fig. 2) [1]

Note that an observer, positioned on the optical axis at z≫z0from the gravitational lens, will see an Einstein

We observe that the ﬁrst zero of the projected PSF pattern (9) occurs at the distance of

from the optical axis, which is much larger than any modern optical t elescope [9]. (Note that this PSF broadening is
consistent with the eﬀect of a lens with spherical aberration.) Thus , (9) is good for very small separations, ρ≃ρGL.
However, in realistic cases, assuming that the signal is pointed at th e Sun, receiver’s misalignment may be as much
asρ∼1AU≫ρGL. In this case, we use the approximation for the Bessel functions f or large arguments [8, 10]:

were we used the fact that for large arguments ρ≫ρGLthe function sin(2 kθERρ) is rapidly oscillating; thus, it averages
to 0. Using this in (9), the PSF for ρ≫ρGLtakes the form

As a result, the spatial distribution characteristic to the PSF of th e transmitting lens (9) and (13) will be encoded
in the structure of the transmitted signal [1], guiding our search.
B. Power transmission
To assess the eﬀectiveness of the interstellar power transmission with a stellar gravitational lens, we con-
sider the same energy transmission scenario used to derive (1). We again assume that transmission is charac-
terized by the beam divergence set by the telescope’s aperture dtyielding angular resolution of θ0≃λ/dt=4Ampliﬁcation ( ×1010)

mitter, the beam is expanded to a large spot with the radius of ρ∗= (zt+zr)(λ/dt). However, in this case, we need
account for the fact that while passing by the lens, the light intensit y is ampliﬁed according to (9). This is due to
the fact that the lens collimates the otherwise diverging beam of light , thus delivering a larger power density to the
receiver (see Fig.1). As a result, a receiver telescope gets a large r fraction of the transmitted power

Therefore, thanks to gravitationallensing, there is a signiﬁcant p hoton ﬂux at the receiver. Now we need to consider
the feasibility of such a transmission link. For this, we have to evaluat e the contribution of major noise sources to the
overall detection sensitivity.
C. Major noise source
The angular radius of a stellar lens is RL/z= 2.26×10−9(RL/R⊙)(10pc/z)rad, which is similar to that of the size
of the Einstein ring formed by the transmitted beam of light (10). As the angular resolution of the largest telescopes
today [9] is λ/dr≃1×10−7(λ/1µm)(10m/dt), they will not be able to resolve neither the star nor the ring, ther efore,
the use of a coronagraph is out of the question. Thus, the brightn ess of that lensing star received by the telescope
will be the noise that must be dealt with.
To estimate the relevant photon ﬂux, we consider our Sun. When de aling with laser light propagatingin its vicinity,
we need to be concern with the ﬂux within some bandwidth ∆ λaround the laser wavelength λ, assuming we can ﬁlter
the light that falls outside ∆ λ. Taking the Sun’s temperature to be T⊙= 5772 K, we estimate the solar brightness
from the Planck’s radiation law and derive the luminosity of the Sun with in a narrow bandwidth:

Thus, although the stellar ﬂux is very strong (17), it can be signiﬁca ntly reduced by using a narrow bandpass ﬁlter
at the receiver, centering it at the transmission wavelength (18).

We use results (15) and (18) and estimate the SNR as usual
SNR =QGL√QGL+Q⋆. (19)
Below, we will consider the detection sensitivity in the noise- and signa l-dominated regimes.
A. Noise-dominated regime
When noise dominates the signal, Q⋆≫QGL, for a receiver close to the optical axis, ρ≃ρGL, the maximal value of
the SNR is given as

Note that (20) was obtained using a modest transmitted power of 1 W. However, that power may be much higher.
In fact, modern commercially-available industrial lasers already fea ture powers of 1–50 kW. Furthermore, coherent
beam combination of multiple transmitting laser beams may result in the total transmitted power of up to a few
GW and more. In addition, both transmit and receive apertures may be much larger than ∼1m which was used in
estimates above. In these cases, the signal may be much stronge r than the noise, outshining the star, requiring a
diﬀerent evaluation of (19), which will be done next.
B. Signal-dominated regime

Clearly, in a search for transmitted laser signals understanding the SNR is essential. We observe that both esti-
mates (20) and (21) represent handsome levels of detection sens itivity demonstrating feasibility of interstellar power
transmission aided by gravitational lensing.
IV. DETECTION STRATEGIES
Detection of laser signals encounters several diﬃculties. The initial challenge is the highly monochromatic nature
of lasers emitting light at a speciﬁc wavelength. This unique attribute requires ﬁnding the exact λmatching that
of an extraterrestrial signal. This also relates to choosing an appr opriate width of the narrow band-pass ﬁlter, ∆ λ,
to improve the SNR, especially in the case of the noise-dominated reg ime (20). There is also directionality of laser
transmissions. Contrary to radio waves that can disperse omnidire ctionally, laser beams are highly focused and
narrow. While interstellar gas and dust are largely permeable to near -IR light interstellar laser signals require precise
alignment toward Earth to fall within the detection threshold. As a r esult: although, stellar brightness (18) and6
optical background noise are rather well known for each star to b e surveyed, the link parameters of the transmitted
signal (power, aperture, wavelength, pointing, etc.) used (15) a re not available a priory.
Gravitational lensing makes the challenges above less critical, provid ing a good guidance: The signal that we are
looking for has the spatial structure of the PSF of the transmittin g lens (9). As such, its structure is known: At
typical wavelengths, in the image plane, the spatial frequency of t his pattern is on the scale of 100s of meters (as
given by (10) and shown in Fig.3), while its amplitude is proportional to the inverse of the radial distance from the
center of the pattern, as seen in (13) as well as in (15)–(16). This is useful for the search.
A. Considering a search campaign
For an interstellar transmission via gravitation lensing, delivery of a t ransmitter to the focal region of a stellar
lens is critical. If that technology is available, then supplying the tran smitter with enough propulsion capabilities
is similarly plausible. Thus, we may assume that the transmitter is capa ble of compensating for the relative proper
motion between the lens and the Sun, simply directing the signal at th e Sun.
The duration over which such lensing event can be observed depend s on the width of the received beam and Earth’s
orbital velocity. To model the dynamics of the event, we assume a v anishing impact parameter and consider the
parallactic motion of an Earth-bound observer, µrel=v⊕/z. Under such conditions, the duration of a lensing event,
∆tER, or the time for the receiver to cross the entire diameter of the Ein stein ring (occurring twice a year) is
∆tER=2θER
µrel=2/radicalbig2rgz0

hr. (22)
Note that this is the duration of the entire lensing event. A full Einst ein ring would only be visible if the impact
parameter is very small, and even then, only brieﬂy. In that time, th e lens will brighten featuring the ampliﬁed laser
signal in accord with (9). The actual duration of the appearance o f the full Einstein ring depends also on the size of
the received the beam, since it corresponds to the observer trav ersing its width. The spatial structure of the received
beam is that of the PSF of the transmitted lens projected on the so lar system, with the width of its main lobe given
byρGLfrom (11), which is crossed by Earth in just

What can be observed a photometric campaign is the varying light amp liﬁcation as the Earth moves relative to
direction to the lensing star with angular separation between them in units of the Einstein ring, u=θ/θER, withθER

of the event and is given by (22). The objective is to monitor the brig htness of the nearby stars for a signature of a
microlensing event. The relevant light ampliﬁcation factor is charact eristicfor the lensing within the weak interference
region of the lens [9, 11, 12], which is given as below:

whereAweak.intis from (25) and F0is the nominal ﬂux of the nearby star. In the transmission scenario considered
above, the ﬂux ∆ Fchanges twice a year and is correlated with the Earth’s orbital motio n.7
B. Plausible detection strategies
To optimize observations of such transient events, a cooperative telescope network is essential. This network would
scan the sky to detect repeatable microlensing events originating a t nearby stars with no stellar background that
could be responsible. Integrating multiple facilities could enhance spa tial resolution, crucial for conﬁdent detection
and increasing the probability of capturing transmitted signals.
Although photometric measurement capabilities vary among telesco pes, any single telescope in the network can
perform a broad spectrum of measurements. As a result, a synch ronized network of telescopes will be capable of
generating detailed imagery of the beam, conducting thorough ana lyses of its brightness variability.
Although resolving the Einstein rings with the current generation of optical instruments will be challenging, a
collaborative network of the astronomical facilities may yield valuable information. With each facility recording
brightness measurements and providing its heliocentric position info rmation as a function time, one can use analytical
tools available to monitor and study properties of the microlensing ev ent as it unfolds.
We envision using both large telescopes and constellations of small te lescopes to capture the photometric data
produced by lensing events using the already established photonics and optical engineering technologies. These
systems will work in tandem, mutually supplementing observations an d oﬀering vital data for predicting events.
Several telescopes either in space or both in space and on the grou nd can be combined in a network to observe the
evolving morphology of the Einstein rings as lensing events unfold [9].
As a result, coordinating ground- and space-based telescope obs ervations is important to detect the structure of the
PSF of the transmitting lens as the receiver traverses the projec ted light ﬁeld. To do that, evaluating the capabilities
of current and upcoming astronomical facilities (see [9]) including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope, Euclid, the Vera C. Rubin Observato ry’s LSST, the Thirty Meter Telescope, and the
Extremely Large Telescope, complemented by a network of smaller t elescopes is timely, as these facilities may be able
to facilitate the search for the faint transient signals transmitted to us by our galactic neighbors.
V. DISCUSSION
Every star is destined to form an Einstein ring. This ring may form nat urally with distant sources or through
advanced technology, deliberately deployed to send us a message. The position of an Einstein ring around a star,
as detailed in (10), depends on our distance to the star, the star’s mass, and the transmitter’s location. With this
information, we can initiate our search for the laser transmissions e nabled by gravitational lensing.
Through a synergistic eﬀort, we will soon travel to the focal regio n of the solar gravitational lens (SGL), enabling
direct high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets in ou r galactic neighborhood [13, 14]. However, before
this, we must also survey nearby stars for potential signs of signa ls sent through gravitational lensing-enabled trans-
mission links. Upon the mission’s arrival at the focal region of the SGL , we will have the capacity to observe the
surface of exoplanets and initiate meaningful information exchang es with any inhabitants.
To advance such a moment, we considered the propagation of EM wa ves in the vicinity of a monopole gravitational
lens. We explored a scenario with near-perfect alignment among the transmitter, the lens, and the receiver. In this
axially-symmetric case, we successfully solved the relevant diﬀract ion integrals analytically, yielding valuable insights.
We explored the case where a transmitter lies in the focal regionof a nearby star, with the receiverpositioned within
our solar system. Although one must account for other light sourc es near the lens, their impact on the achievable
SNRs is expected to be minimal. Given the high sensitivities, we consider the strategies in the search for transmitted
signals using existing astronomical facilities or involving development o f new facilities dedicated for this purpose.
Our ﬁndings reveal that microlensing events, corresponding to las er signals transmitted through nearby gravi-
tational lenses, are transient but notably bright, making them det ectable with current instruments. Given their
brightness, these microlensing events can be detected and analyz ed through a dedicated campaign of photometric
observations. Deploying a network of astronomical facilities can en hance detection sensitivity. Consequently, we have
demonstrated the feasibility of establishing interstellar power tran smission links via gravitational lensing and also
our technological readiness to receive those signal—a ﬁnding with pr ofound implications in the search for interstellar
power transmissions. Now is the right time to design, develop and initia te an appropriate search campaign.8
