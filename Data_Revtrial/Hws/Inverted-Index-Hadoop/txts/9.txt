We offer a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian
(PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for
the Robertson parameter γin Brans-Dicke gravity for spherical compact mass sources, explicitly
incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the integrability
of the 00−component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result
γPPN=ω+1
ω+2, we obtain the analytical expression γexact =ω+1+(ω+2)Θ
ω+2+(ω+1)ΘwhereΘis the ratio of the
total pressure P∗
∥+2P∗
⊥and total energy E∗contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative
formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. Importantly,
the dimensionless quantity Θparticipates in the γparameter due to the higher-derivative nature of
Brans-Dicke gravity. In addition, we establish two new mathematical identities linking the active
gravitational mass, the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) mass, and the Tolman mass, applicable for
Brans-Dicke gravity. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual γPPNformula is violated in
the presence of pressure, viz. when Θ̸= 0, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in
Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter.
Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN formula for γ.
Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when Θ≈0, for
all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on γsetjointbounds onωandΘ, with the latter
representingaglobalcharacteristicofamasssource. Iftheequationofstateofmattercomprisingthe
mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing Θ≃1,γexactconverges to 1irrespective
ofω. (4) In a broader context, by exposing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke
gravity, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in
observational astronomy when testing candidate theories of gravitation, particularly those with a
higher-derivative nature.
I. MOTIVATION
The parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) framework
has been an invaluable tool in the study of gravita-
tional theories [1–3]. It is founded upon the assump-
tions of weak field and slow motion, representing the
post-Newtonian limit of gravity. In this limit, the frame-
workcharacterizesagivenmetrictheory, atthefirstpost-
Newtonian level, by a set of ten real-valued parameters.
One of the most powerful applications of the PPN for-
malismisthecalculationoftheRobertson(orEddington-
Robertson-Schiff) parameter γ. This important parame-
ter governs the amount of space-curvature produced by
a body at rest and can be directly measured via the de-
tection of light deflection and the Shapiro time delay.
For one of the simplest extensions beyond General Rel-
ativity (GR)—the Brans-Dicke (BD) theory—the PPN
approach is known to yield
γPPN=ω+ 1
ω+ 2(1)
∗hoang.nguyen@ubbcluj.ro
†bertrand.chauvineau@oca.euwhereωis the BD parameter. This formula recovers the
resultγGR= 1known for GR in the limit of infinite ω,
in which the BD scalar field approaches a constant field.
Current bounds using Solar System observations set the
magnitude of ωto exceed 40,000. Generalizations of the
PPNγresult to other modified theories of gravity are
available [1, 2, 4–17].
In the case of GR, by virtue of Birkhoff’s theorem,
spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are static and
asymptotically flat. The vacuum spacetime exterior of
a mass source is described by the Schwarzschild met-
ric which is dependent on only one parameter, the
Schwarzschild radius. All information regarding the in-
ternal structure and composition of the source, namely,
the types of matter comprising it as well as the distribu-
tion profile of matter in the source, is fully encapsulated
in the Schwarzschild radius. Since GR, as a classical the-
ory, lacks an inherent length scale (such as the Planck
length), the dimensionful Schwarzschild radius cannot
participate in the dimensionless γparameter. Thus, this
parameter is independent of the source in GR (a fact
compatible with γGR= 1).
BD gravity, however, has a richer structure due to the
BD scalar field Φ, an additional degree of freedom be-arXiv:2404.00094v1  [gr-qc]  29 Mar 20242
sidesthemetriccomponents. Forthespecialcaseofblack
holes, the no-hair theorem applies [18, 19], meaning that
the static non-rotating spherisymmetric vacuum exterior
to a black hole in BD gravity is a Schwarzschild solution.
Consequently, black holes in BD gravity, irrespective of
the value of ω, haveγ= 1rather than the usualω+1
ω+2
result. Besides black holes, BD gravity exhibits other
structures—normal stars and exotic ones, such as worm-
holes and naked singularities [20–22]. For these struc-
tures, the BD scalar field in the exterior vacuum is gen-
erally non-constant. The PPN formalism makes use of
thenon-constancy inΦto derive the usual PPN result
for stars, given in Eq. (1), which explicitly depends on
the BD parameter ω[23]. Yet, it is important to note
that the PPN γparameter, per Eq. (1), contains no in-
formation about the star (aside from the fact that the
star is regular at its center), as the BD parameter ωis a
parameter of the theory, not one of the resulting exterior
vacuum.
In contrast to the second-derivative GR, where
all information about the stellar source is condensed
into one single parameter—the Schwarzschild radius—
BD gravity, as a higher-order theory, permits the
internal structure of the star to influence higher-
derivative characteristics of the exterior solution, po-
tentially leaving its footprints on the PPN parame-
ters. In their seminal work [26], Brans and Dicke
recognized the approximate nature of estimating the
two parameters characterizing the exterior vacuum so-
lution, later known as the Brans Class I solution [27].
This recognition was evidenced in Eq. (34) of Ref. [26].
The PPN formula in Eq. (1) should be regarded as an
approximation applicable in the limit of weak field ev-
erywhere (including inside the star) and slow motion in
BD gravity, whereby the higher-derivative features of the
exterior vacuum are suppressed. An important question
arises:Can the internal structure of a star in BD gravity,
and in modified theories in general, manifest through the
PPN parameters? And if so, under what conditions?
An obvious course of action would be to lift the weak
field hypothesis on the source of the field, enabling an ex-
act calculation of the external field, from which the PPN
parameters can be extracted. An attempt in this direc-
tion has been made recently in [24] where it is suggested
that the higher-order terms can impact the γparameter.
Yet,thereexistsanothercondition,albeitlessexplicit,re-
lated to the pressure within the star. Note that the PPN
requirement of slow motion applies not only for macro-
scopic objects but also for their microscopic constituents.
Per the post-Newtonian bookkeeping scheme in Ref. [1],
this translates to a requirement for low pressure rela-
tive to the energy content. Whereas a star is stationary,
the microscopic motion of the matter contained within its
domain can be relativistic , resulting in appreciably high
pressure compared with its energy content.
Despite the challenges of relaxing the weak-field and
low-pressure constraints, significant progress can beachieved in one particular situation—the BD theory. In
our current study and its companion paper [25], we focus
on a specific case—the BD exterior vacuum surrounding
a matter spherical distribution which has a finite domain
of support; we shall collectively call this type of structure
a compact star. Here, we rigorously account for the influ-
ence of the compact mass source on the exterior vacuum
and theγparameter without resorting to any approxima-
tions. We achieve this by making use of the integrability
of the 00-component of the BD field equations, enabling
us to circumvent the limitations of the weak-field and
low-pressureapproximations. Advancementsindetection
methods allow for the study of neutron stars, making our
investigation relevant both for practical applications and
theoretical inquiries into the formalism and methodolo-
gies employed. Our study shall shed light on the role of
stellar pressure and provide a benchmark for assessing its
impacts in theories of modified gravity.
This paper complements its companion paper, Ref.
[25], and is organized as follows. Section II revisits
the form of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of star
sources in BD gravity. Sections III and IV handle the
fieldequationsinthestandardcoordinatesandtransform
the results to the isotropic coordinates. The uniqueness
of Brans solutions is addressed in Section V. Sections
VI and VII conduct the interior-exterior matching and
derive theγparameter. Section VIII obtains mass re-
lations, valid for BD gravity. Sections IX and X offer
discussions and outlooks. A further exposition on the
uniqueness of Brans solutions is given in Appendix A.

It is well documented [28] that upon the Weyl map-
ping/braceleftbig

, the gravitational sector
of the BD action can be brought to the Einstein frame as/integraltext

. The Einstein-frame
BD scalar field ˜Φhas a kinetic term with a signum de-
termined by (ω+ 3/2). Unless stated otherwise, we shall
restrictourconsiderationtothenormal(“non-phantom”)
case ofω>−3/2, where the kinetic energy for ˜Φis pos-
itive.
In this paper, we work exclusively in the Jordan frame.
For convenience, let us denote a rank-two tensor
Xµν:= ΦRµν−∇µ∇νΦ−ω
Φ∇µΦ∇νΦ(3)3
The BD field equation for the metric components is
Xµν= 8π/bracketleftig

and the equation for the BD scalar field is

For a coordinate system that is static and spherically
symmetric, the metric can be written as (with g01=
g10= 0)
ds2=−A(r)dt2+B(r)dr2+C(r)dΩ2(7)
With this metric, the only non-vanishing components of
the tensor Xµνare the diagonal ones, namely, µ=ν.
With respect to the off-diagonal components, µ̸=ν,
sincegµν= 0, the field equation requires
Tµν= 0ifµ̸=ν (8)

X33=X22sin2θ (10)
one has
T33=T22sin2θ=⇒T3

Therefore, the EMT must adopt the following form

−ϵ(r) 0 0 0

0 0 p⊥(r) 0
0 0 0 p⊥(r)

The only assumptions we made are the stationarity and
spherical symmetry for the metric components and the
BD scalar field. The energy density ϵ, the radial pressure
p∥and the tangential pressure p⊥are functions of r. The
trace is simplified to
T=−ϵ+p∥+ 2p⊥ (13)
We shall not impose any further constraints on the
EMT, which can be anisotropic.
III. INTEGRABILITY OF THE 00−FIELD
EQUATION
Let us start with the standard areal coordinate system
ds2=−A(r)dt2+B(r)dr2+r2dΩ2(14)In this form, a star center exists at r= 0, at which the
metric components, A(r)andB(r)and the BD field Φ(r)
are regular (including their first derivatives with respect
tor). The scalar field equation (5) yields

Remark 1.The integrability property that we exploited
in deriving Eqs. (17) and (22) is not limited to the stan-
dard coordinates. If we used the metric in Eq. (7), the
left hand side of Eqs. (17) and (22) would read C/radicalig

arrespectively, and the√−gterm in the right
hand side of these equation would be calculated using
the latter metric. Nevertheless, the standard-coordinate
metric in (14) explicitly reveals the presence of the point
r= 0at which the surface area of a 2-sphere vanishes.
This point naturally corresponds to the star’s center and
serves as the lower bound in the integrals defined in (23).

The term√
A, equal to√−g00, is a “redshift fac-
tor”. The combination r2√
Bdr sinθdθdφ, equal to
r2√g11drsinθdθdφ, is the spatial volume element in the
spatial part of the metric given in Eq. (14). Note that
in the region occupied with matter, e.g. where ϵ(r)̸= 0,
the space in general is not Euclidean; consequently, for
the standard-coordinate metric, B(r)deviates from 1.
It should also be noted that the combination
r2√g11drsinθdθdφis equal to/radicalbig
g(3)dV, whereg(3)is
the determinant of the spatial section of the metric in Eq.
(14). The combination is thus invariant with respect to
a twice-differentiable transformation of the radial coordi-
nate. The quantities E∗,P∗
∥, andP∗
⊥can be interpreted
as the total energy, radial pressure, and tangential pres-
sure contained within the compact star.IV. ‌TRANSFORMING TO ISOTROPIC
COORDINATES
With the total energy and pressures defined via Eq.
(24), the set of equations (17), (22), (26), and (28) es-
sentially provide the “conservation” rules for the metric
components and the BD scalar in the exterior vacuum,
i.e., forr>r∗, per

Note that the right hand sides of Eqs. (29) and (30) are

in the interior of the compact mass source.
Ournextstepistorelatethe parameters oftheexterior
vacuum to these constants. The vacuum solution for BD
gravity is best known in the isotropic coordinate, in the
form of the Brans Class I solution. (The issue with the
generality and uniqueness of the Brans Class I solution
shall be addressed in Section V.) It is thus necessary to
bring the left hand sides of Eqs. (29) and (30) to the
isotropic coordinate ρ, namely, using the following metric
ds2=−F(ρ)dt2+G(ρ)/parenleftbig
dρ2+ρ2dΩ2/parenrightbig
(31)
and the BD scalar ϕ(ρ). Transforming (14) into (31)
requires the following identifications
F(ρ) =A(r);G(ρ)/parenleftbiggdρ

=B(r);G(ρ)ρ2=r2(32)
in addition to a mapping for the BD scalar

Remark 3.As we stated at the end of the preceding sec-
tion, the energy density and pressure quantities are in-
variant upon a coordinate transformation in the radial

example, the total energy in the standard coordinates is

V. BRANS CLASS I AS THE UNIQUE
VACUUM SOLUTION FOR ω>−3/2
Equations (36) and (37) stand handy for us to relate
the parameters of the exterior vacuum solution to the
energy-pressure integrals. It is well documented that the
BransClassIsolutionisavacuumsolutioninBDgravity.
In this section, we shall furtherdemonstrate that, for the
case of non-phantom kinetic energy for the BD field, viz.
ω>−3/2, the Brans Class I solution is the most general
andunique vacuum solution. That is to say, the Brans
Class I solution is thevacuum solution in BD gravity,
whenω>−3/2.
Historically, Brans discovered the solutions during his
PhD thesis and reported them in [27] without offering
a derivation, although the solutions can be verified via
direct inspection. The earliest public account for an ana-
lytical derivation of these solutions can be traced back to
Ref. [28] in which Bronnikov discovered the more general
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum solution.
The Brans solutions are comprised of 4 different
classes (or types). In the exposition of Bronnikov[28], the Brans-Dicke theory is first mapped from
the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame via a Weyl
mapping. The transformed BD scalar field becomes
uncoupled (thus free) scalar field which sources the
Einstein-frame spacetime metric. This transformed
theory is known to admit the Fisher-Janis-Newman-
Winicour (FJNW) solution. (Note: The solution has
been re-discovered several times, and is also known as
the Fisher-Bergmann-Leipnik-Janis-Newman-Winicour-
Buchdahl-Wyman (FBLJNWBW) solution [29–34].) Via
theEinstein-framerepresentation, ithasbeenestablished
by now that the classes of Brans solutions are the most
generalsolutions that are static and spherisymmetric in
Brans-Dicke gravity [34, 35].
However, the existence of multiple Brans classes has
sidetracked a recognition of their “uniqueness”. There
is a degree of redundancy in these classes, however. In
[35] Bhadra and Sarkar pointed out that Class III and
Class IV are equivalent via a coordinate transformation,
ρ↔1/ρ, reducing the count of classes to 3. These au-
thors also uncovered a “symmetry” in terms of parame-
tersof Brans Class I and Brans Class II, upon making
certain replacement in the parameters (and a coordinate
transform)1. Consequently, it was deemed that the two
classes, I and II, were equivalent, leaving only Class I
and Class III to be truly independent. Nomenclature
aside, it should be noted that diffeomorphism alone can-
not transform Class I into Class II and vice versa. In
[34] Faraoni and colleagues revisited this issue and cor-
rectlybrandedthe“symmetry”alludedabovea“duality”
rather than an “equivalence”. As we shall show momen-
tarily, the 3 Brans classes (I, II, and IV) remain separate
solutions (while fully covering) in the parameter space.
Yet, the 3 classes can be “unified” upon an appropriate
parametrization. That is to say, all 3 Brans classes of
solution can be brought into a single form, as we shall do
below.
Consider the metric and scalar field

Let us emphasize that the recasting exercise thus far
represents nothing essentially new . The important point
which our recasting offers is that the signum of κelects
the “class” that the “unified” Brans solution, Eq. (43),
belongs. Moreover, a pair of {ω,Λ}uniquely determines
the signum for κ, and hence the form of the solution.
Figure 1 shows the categorization. In the {ω,Λ}plane,
the two branches of the solid line correspond to the loci
ofκ= 0, viz. (1 + Λ)2−Λ/parenleftbig
1−ωΛ/2/parenrightbig
= 0. Above and
below the solid line are the domains for Brans Class I and
Brans Class II, respectively. The 3 classes do not overlap
while fully covering the {ω,Λ}plane. The ambiguity in
selecting the solution is removed. The uniqueness of the
“unified”Branssolution, Eq. (43), istherebyestablished.
Remark 4.Forω >−3/2, the function κis positive-
definite for all values of ΛinR, as can be seen by rewrit-
ingκas
κ=[(ω+ 2)Λ + 1]2+ 2ω+ 3
2(ω+ 2)>0forω>−3/2(55)
Consequently, only Brans Class I is admissible for the
non-phantom action, ω>−3/2, a fact evident in Fig. 1.
Remark5.It is worth noting that Brans Class I recovers
the Schwarzschild metric when Λ = 0forcingκ= 1. On
the other hand, Brans Class II and Class III do not have
this property and are often relegated as “pathological”
solutions. Conveniently, they only exist for the phantom
action, i.e., ω⩽−3/2.
2Brans Class III is obtainable from Brans Class IV via a coordi-
nate transform, ρ=M2
1/(4ρ′).7
Another way to recognize the unified nature of the 3
Brans solutions is via the harmonic coordinate instead of
the isotropic coordinate [28]. For completeness, we shall
revisit this representation in Appendix A.
VI. MATCHING THE EXTERIOR SOLUTION
WITH ENERGY-PRESSURE INTEGRALS
As established in the preceding section, for the non-
phantom kinetic action (i.e., ω >−3/2), the exterior
vacuum solution is exclusively Brans Class I. We are now
equipped to perform the matching of its parameters.
With the metric given in Eq. (43), the left hand sides
of Eqs. (36) and (37) readily yield

Brans Class I solution under consideration.VII. THE ROBERTSON PARAMETERS

Comparing Eqs. (65) against Eq. (66), we obtain
βexact = 1 (67)
γexact = 1 + Λ (68)
where we have added in the subscript “exact” as empha-
sis. Note that Λmeasures the deviation of the γparam-
eters from GR ( γGR= 1). From Eq. (62), Λdepends on
bothωandΘ. Finally, we arrive at
γexact =ω+ 1 + (ω+ 2)Θ
ω+ 2 + (ω+ 1)Θ(69)
which can also be conveniently recast as
γexact =γPPN+Θ
1 +γPPNΘ(70)
by recalling that γPPN=ω+1
ω+2. With the aid of Eqs. (60)
and (61), the active gravitational mass is

the quantity Mgravis the active gravitation mass of the

Furthermore, in GR,the ADM mass hasbeen established
within the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff framework (us-
ing the standard coordinates) to be
mADM = 4π/integraldisplayr∗
0drr2ϵ(r) (84)
Using Eq. (23) in the standard coordinates (14), we
rewrite the right hand side of Eq. (83) as

We thus have re-derived the Tolman relation in GR, as a
by-product of our study [37, 38].IX. DISCUSSIONS
Formula (69) is the final outcome of our derivation.
This section aims to clarify a number of logical and tech-
nical steps taken in the derivation, and discusses the im-
plications of Formula (69).
Our derivation proceeded in the following steps:
1. Assuming the metric and the mass source to be
stationary and spherically symmetric, we deduced
from the BD field equation that the most gen-
eral EMT of the source can be put in the form
Tν
µ=diag/parenleftbig
−ϵ(r),p∥(r),p⊥(r),p⊥(r)/parenrightbig
. Whereas
the EMT can be anisotropic, we imposed no fur-
therconditionsontheEMT,suchasbeingaperfect
fluid. See Section II.
2. The standard coordinate system, ds2=
−A(r)dt2+B(r)dr2+r2dΩ2, is suitable for
describing stars. Using the scalar field equation
forΦand the 00−component of the field equa-
tion, and imposing regularity conditions at the
star’s center, we derived two ODE’s—Eqs. (17)
and (22)—which express A(r),B(r)and Φ(r)
in theexterior vacuum in terms of the total
energyE∗and total pressure P∗
∥+ 2P∗
⊥contained
within the star . The standard coordinate sys-
tem allows for the existence of the point r= 0
at which the surface area of the 2-sphere van-
ishes, which naturally serves as the star’s center.
This point acts as the lower bound for the domain
of integration for E∗andP∗
∥+2P∗
⊥. See Section III.
3. We next transformed the two aforementioned
ODE’s into the isotropic coordinate system, ds2=
−F(ρ)dt2+G(ρ)/parenleftbig
dρ2+ρ2dΩ2/parenrightbig
. The resulting
ODE’s in terms of F(ρ),G(ρ)andϕ(ρ)are Eqs.
(36) and (37). The advantage of the isotropic coor-
dinates is that the exterior solution is best known
in this system (i.e., the Brans solutions). Further-
more, the energy and pressure integrals, E∗and
P∗
∥+ 2P∗
⊥, are unchanged when moving to this sys-
tem. See Section IV.
4. Wenextpresentedthe“unified”Branssolution,Eq.
(43), which cover all Brans Classes I, II and IV
(with Class III being equivalent to Class IV). For
a non-phantom action, i.e. ω>−3/2, Brans Class
I is the most general and uniquestatic spherisym-
metric vacuum solution. For a phantom action, i.e.
ω<−3/2, all 3 Brans classes are admissible; how-
ever, only one single class is selected for a given set
of parameters of the “unified” Brans solution. The
uniqueness of the “unified” Brans solution is thus
established. See Section V.
5. We employed theBrans Class I solution to perform
the matching of the functions F(ρ),G(ρ)andϕ(ρ)9
withtheenergyandpressureintegrals, E∗andP∗
∥+
2P∗
⊥. See Section VI.
6. Expressing the Brans Class I metric in the Robert-
son expansion, we obtain the γparameter in terms
ofωand a (dimensionless) Θ, defined as the ratio
ofP∗
∥+ 2P∗
⊥andE∗. See Section VII.
7. As a by-product, we obtained two mathematical
relations linking the active gravitational mass and
the ADM mass with the energy and pressure inte-
grals for BD gravity. In addition, we (re)-derived
the Tolman relation in GR. See Section VIII.
Generality of our derivation —(i)Non-perturbative ap-
proach: Our derivation is non-perturbative in nature. It
makes use of the integrability of the 00−component of
the BD field equation, along with the scalar field equa-
tioninvolving □Φ. (ii)Minimal assumptions : Thephysi-
cal assumptions employed are the regularity at the star’s
center and the existence of the star’s surface separat-
ing the interior and the exterior. Our derivation relies
solely on the scalar field equation and the 00-component
of the field equation, without the need for the full set
of equations, specifically the 11−and22−components
of the field equation. Consequently, the conservation
equation (by way of the Bianchi identity) is not re-
quired. (iii) Universality of result: The final formula,
Eq. (69), holds for all field strengths and all types of
matter (whether convective or non-convective, for exam-
ple). We do not assume the matter comprising the stars
to be a perfect fluid or isentropic.
Higher-derivative characteristics —In contrast to the
one-parameter Schwarzschild metric, the Brans Class I
solution depends on two parameters, i.e. the solution is
not only defined by its gravitational mass, but also by a
scalar mass besides the gravitational one [28]. This is be-
cause the BD description of gravity involves more fields
than the only metric involved in GR, a scalar field being
also part of the gravitational sector. (The same is also
to be expected in the higher order theories framework,
likef(R)theories, since f(R)theories can be recast as
ω= 0BD theories endowed with a scalar dependent
potential.) The exterior BD vacuum should reflect the
internal structure and composition of the star. This ex-
pectation is confirmed in the final result, Eq. (69), which
underscores the participation of the parameter Θ.
Role of pressure —Figure 2 shows a contour plot of
γexactas a function of γPPN(i.e,ω+1
ω+2) andΘ. There
are two interesting observations:
•An ultra-relativistic limit, Θ≲1, would render
γexact≃1,regardless ofω.
•For Newtonian stars, i.e. low pressure ( Θ≈0), the
PPN result is a good approximation regardless of
the field strength.
Figure 2. Contour plot of γexactin terms of Θandω+1
ω+2. A
measuredγexact≈1could meanω+1
ω+2≈1(i.e.,ω≫1) orΘ≈
1(i.e., ultra-relativistic matter). Contours are equally spaced
in 0.01 increments. For a given contour, the corresponding
value ofγexactcan be read on the abscissa axis, where the
contour intersects it.
O(1/√ω)anomaly—It has been discovered that the
Brans-Dicke-Maxwell (electro)vacuum does not necessar-
ilyconvergetoavacuumofGR[43–52]. Additionally, the
convergence rate is 1/√ωrather than the usual 1/ωbe-
havior. Recently, the present authors proved that this
O(1/√ω)anomaly exists for all types of matter regard-
less of the trace of the EMT [53] (see also [54, 55]). For
this anomaly to occur, the “remnant” BD scalar field
needs to exhibit a singularity or time-dependence. How-
ever, these conditions are not satisfied for static stars,
where regularity requirements are imposed. Therefore,
the violation of γreported in this current article is not
related to theO(1/√ω)anomaly.
On the loss of Birkhoff’s theorem— It can be argued
that, in BD gravity, the loss of Birkhoff’s theorem and
the dependence of γon a star’s internal structure may be
interconnected. Indeed, let us consider, in BD gravity, a
static spherisymmetric Newtonian star (initial state). Its
exterior vacuum is described by a Brans Class I solution
given by Eq. (43), characterized by 2 parameters M1and
Λ(or equivalently κper Eq. (44)). Note that the param-
eterΛdepends on the pressure content of the star, as is
evident in Eq. (62). For the initial Newtonian star, since
p≪ϵinside the whole star, Θiniis approximately zero,
rendering Λini≈−1
ω+2. Let us now consider that this
star starts collapsing, and that the collapse ends at some
(final) compact state. The pressure is no longer negli-
gible with respect to ϵin this final state, in such a way
that the final value Θfinis significant, making Λfinsignif-
icantly differing from Λini. On the other hand, Birkhoff’s
theorem in GR mandates that any spherisymmetric vac-
uum must be independent of the coordinate tregardless
of the(time-) evolution of the source. If Birkhoff’s the-
orem were valid for BD gravity, the vacuum exterior to10
the collapsing star would have been left unchanged dur-
ing the process (i.e. a time independent solution), which
is incompatible with the observation that the final Λfin
differs from the initial one Λini. Thence, the fact that
Λexplicitly depends on Θ, as described by Eq. (62), im-
plies that Birkhoff’s theorem cannot hold for BD gravity.
Reciprocally, the strong necessity to revisit the BD grav-
ity’s PPNγexpression could have been anticipated from
the mere fact that Birkhoff’s theorem is not valid in BD
gravity.
X. CLOSING AND OUTLOOKS
We derived the exact analytical formula, Eq. (69),
of the Robertson parameter γfor compact mass sources
in BD gravity. The derivation’s success hinges on the
integrability of the 00−component of the field equation,
rendering it non-perturbative and applicable for any field
strengthandtypeofmatterconstitutingthesource. This
paper provides comprehensive technical insights to com-
plement a companion paper [25], which delves into phys-
ical implications of our findings.
Outlook #1—The conventional PPN result for BD
gravityγPPN =ω+1
ω+2lacks dependence on the physi-
cal features of the mass source, a trait shared by other
alternative theories beyond GR, such as the Bergman-
Wagoner theory. In the light of our exact result, the
γPPNshould be regarded as an approximation for stars
in modified gravity under low-pressure conditions. Our
findings underscore the limitations of the PPN formal-
ism, particularly in scenarios characterized by high star
pressure. Itisplausibletoexpectthattheroleofpressure
may extend to other modified theories of gravitation.
Outlook #2—The energy and pressure integrals, E∗
andP∗
∥+ 2P∗
⊥defined in Eq. (23), can be evaluated
within the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) frame-
work for BD gravity. This approach entails developing
the TOV equations and integrating them from the star’s
center outward. The resulting exterior solution is fully
determined by factors such as the equation of state of
the star’s constituent matter and the central pressure of
the star. Accordingly, the matching between the interior
spacetime solution and the exterior vacuum is automati-
cally handled when the integration crosses the surface at
which the pressure vanishes. However, it should be noted
that the integration procedure is numerical in nature, as
there is currently no exact analytical solution available
for the interior of stars in BD gravity. Inspired by our
exactγderivation presented in this paper, details regard-
ing the TOV equation for BD gravity, presented in a new
optimal gauge choice, are currently underway [42].ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Appendix A: Mapping the unified Brans solution to

with the “Bronnikov” function (first introduced in [28])
defined as
s(χ, u) :=1√χsinh√χu (A8)
The proper part satisfies the radial harmonic gauge. De-
pending on whether χis positive, null, or negative, the
function is numerically equal to
s(χ, u) =

1√χsinh√χuifχ>0
u ifχ= 0
1√−χsin√−χuifχ<0(A9)11
The three cases correspond to Brans Class I, Class IV,
and Class II, in that order. Plugging Eqs. (A4) and
(A5) in to Eq. (44), we obtain the following “constraint”
among the parameters
χ=a2+ (2ω+ 3)b2(A10)
Obviously, a pair of {ω, a/b}uniquely specifies the
signum for χ.This is nothing but the metric obtained
in the harmonic radial coordinate u, presented in Bron-
nikov [28]. The proper part of the metric is the Fisher-
Janis-Newman-Winicour (FJNW) solution [29–34].) The
generality of this metric is thus established therein. For
ω >−3/2,χ > 0is the Brans Class I. Whereas ω <
−3/2, all three possibilities for χpositive, null, negative
are admissible. However, for a given pair of {ω, a/b}, the
signum ofχis uniquely determined, selecting the class
that the solution belongs. The ambiguity in picking one
solution among the three possibilities is removed.
One final remark is that Bronnikov used a slightly dif-
ferent notation which may have obscured the “unique-ness” of the Brans solutions [28])

The three cases correspond to Brans Class I, Class IV,
and Class II, in that order.
The distinction between (A9) and (A12) is subtle.
Comparing the two functions, kcan be formally iden-
tified with√−χ. However, with χ∈R,√−χcan be real
or pure imaginary, whereas the kparameter in (A12)
needs be defined separately for χ > 0andχ < 0. The
“bifurcation” at k= 0may have obscured the duality be-
tween Brans Class I and Class II, an issue we elucidated
in the Section V.
